1. Instant Insecurity: Security Issues of Instant Messaging
By Neal Hindocha

Instant messaging services are becoming an increasingly popular form of
communication, both in the personal and the professional spheres. This
paper will describe instant messaging and offer a brief overview of some
of the security threats associated with the service.

2. Intelligence Gathering: Watching a Honeypot at Work
By Toby Miller

The purpose of this article is share with the security community the data
the author collected from his honeypot. This discussion will include the
attacker's recon, the attack, the attempted cover-up, and the reason for
the attack on the honeypot.

3. Closing the Floodgates: DDoS Mitigation Techniques
by Matthew Tanase

To be on the receiving end of a distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attack is a nightmare scenario for any network administrator, security
specialist or access provider. It begins instantly, without warning, and
continues relentlessly: machines down, jammed bandwidth, overloaded
routers. An effective, immediate response is often difficult and may
depend on third parties, such as ISPs. With these challenges in mind, this
article will explore some techniques that systems administrators and
security professionals can employ should they ever find themselves in this
rather undesirable situation.

II. BUGTRAQ SUMMARY
-------------------
1. OpenTopic Private Message HTML Injection Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6523
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6523
Summary:

OpenTopic is a commercially available content management system.

A HTML injection vulnerability has been reported for OpenTopic. The
vulnerability exists because OpenTopic does not sufficiently sanitize HTML
code from private message posts.

An attacker may include arbitrary HTML and script code in private messages
and when this information is viewed by other users, the attacker-supplied
code will execute in their web client in the security context of the site.

Exploitation may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication
credentials or other attacks.

This vulnerability was reported for OpenTopic 2.3.1. It is not known
whether other versions are affected.

2. DCP-Portal Remote File Include Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6525
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6525
Summary:

DCP-Portal is a freely available content management system implemented in
PHP. It is available for a variety of platforms including Microsoft
Windows and Linux variants.

DCP-Portal is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to
include arbitrary files located on remote servers. This issue is present
in the 'library/editor/editor.php' and 'library/lib.php' scripts included
with DCP-Portal.

An attacker may exploit this by supplying a path to a maliciously created
file, located on an attacker-controlled host as a value for the '$root'
parameter.

If the remote file is a PHP script, this may allow for execution of
attacker-supplied PHP code with the privileges of the webserver.
Successful exploitation may provide local access to the attacker.

This vulnerability was reported for DCP-Portal 5.0.1. It is not known
whether earlier versions are affected.

3. FreeBSD System Call f_count Integer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6524
Remote: No
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6524
Summary:

A vulnerability has been reported in the FreeBSD system. Reportedly, the
fpathconf and lseek system calls are affected by vulnerabilities that may
lead to a kernel integer overflow condition.

The FreeBSD kernel has an internal reference counter maintained for each
file. This counter is incremented whenever additional references to it are
created (for example, by using the dup() system call). The counter is then
decremented for every close() call. System calls that involve files will
issue fhold() and fdrop() calls to increment and decrement this counter.

Reportedly, the fpathconf and lseek system calls do not issue a fdrop()
call. This issue can be exploited by a local attacker by invoking
repeatedly these system calls to eventually overflow the file reference
counter.  An attacker who exploits this vulnerability may cause the system
to panic or to obtain root privileges on the vulnerable system.

This vulnerability has been reported to affect RELENG_4 earlier than
20021111 and all FreeBSD RELEASE versions.

4. DCP-Portal Unauthorized Account Access Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6526
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6526
Summary:

DCP-Portal is a freely available content management system implemented in
PHP. It is available for a variety of platforms including Microsoft
Windows and Linux variants.

DCP-Portal does not sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input for URI
parameters.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by supplying values for the
'dcp5_member_admin' or 'dcp5_member_id' parameters with the appropriate
values. This will allow an attacker to obtain access to user accounts on
the vulnerable site hosting DCP-Portal.

This vulnerability was reported for DCP-Portal 5.0.1. It is not known
whether earlier versions are affected.

5. H-Sphere Webshell Remote Buffer Overrun Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6527
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6527
Summary:

H-Sphere is a multiserver web hosting application. H-Sphere ships with
WebShell, a component designed to be a file manager for uploading
downloading files via FTP. H-Sphere is available for the Windows, Linux,
and Unix operating systems.

A vulnerability has been discovered in H-Sphere Webshell. The problem
occurs during the pre-authentication phase. Due to insufficient bounds
checking on user-supplied HTTP parameters, it is possible for a remote
attacker to cause a buffer to be overrun

The vulnerability occurs in the CGI::readFile() function and can be
triggered by passing the target server an HTTP Content-Type 'boundary'
parameter of excessive length.

Successful exploitation of this issue would allow an attacker to overwrite
the vulnerable functions instruction pointer. By causing the program to
return to attacker-supplied instructions, it may be possible to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the target process.

It should be noted that this issue was discovered in H-Sphere 2.3 RC3. It
is not yet known whether earlier versions are also vulnerable.

6. AN HTTPD HTTP Request Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6528
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6528
Summary:

AN HTTPD is a Japanese language Web server designed for use on Microsoft
Windows operating systems.

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported for AN HTTPD. The
vulnerability exists when AN HTTPD receives overly long HTTP requests.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by issuing a long HTTP request,
consisting of at least 1024 characters, to any CGI or BAT script on the
vulnerable server. When AN HTTPD attempts to process this request, it will
crash.

Although unconfirmed, it may be possible to cause the vulnerable web
server to execute malicious attacker-supplied code.

This vulnerability was reported for AN HTTPD 1.41e.

7. AN HTTPD Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6529
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6529
Summary:

AN HTTPD is a Web server designed for use on Microsoft Windows operating
systems.

AN HTTPD does not adequately filter HTML code thus making it prone to
cross-site scripting attacks. It is possible for a remote attacker to
create a malicious link containing script code which will be executed in
the browser of a legitimate user. All code will be executed within the
context of the website running AN HTTPD.

This issue may be exploited to steal cookie-based authentication
credentials from legitimate users of the website running the vulnerable
software. The attacker may hijack the session of the legitimate by using
cookie-based authentication credentials.

This vulnerability was reported for AN HTTPD 1.41e.

8. Longshine Wireless Access Point Devices Information Disclosure Vulnerabi=
lity
BugTraq ID: 6533
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6533
Summary:

Longshine provides several products for networking including external
wireless LAN access points. An information disclosure vulnerability has
been reported for the Longshine LCS-883R-AC-B WLAN access point.

The Longshine LCS-883R-AC-B device will allow tftp connections without any
authentication. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to connect via
tftp to the access point and download the configuration file.

Obtainable files from the tftp service include config.img, mac.dat, and
rom.img.

The configuration file contains sensitive information including the
administrator password and WEP keys. An attacker who has access to this
information may be able to modify existing settings and intercept traffic
from the access point.

** The D-Link DI-614+ product, reportedly based on the Longshine device,
appears to be vulnerable to this issue.

9. Multiple Vendor Network Device Driver Frame Padding Information Disclosu=
re Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6535
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6535
Summary:

Network device drivers for several vendors have been reported to disclose
potentially sensitive information to attackers.

Frames that are smaller than the minimum frame size should have the unused
portion of the frame buffer padded with null (or other) bytes.  Some
device drivers do not do this adequately, leaving the data that was stored
in the memory comprising the buffer prior to its use intact.
Consequently, this data may be transmitted within frames across ethernet
segments.  As the ethernet frame buffer is allocated in kernel memory
space, sensitive data may be leaked.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a simple ICMP packet
to a vulnerable machine. A response to such a query will involve a packet
that has been padded to a sufficient length. It may be that the
information that is padded is of a sensitive nature. An attacker may use
the information obtained in this manner to launch other attacks against a
vulnerable system.

This vulnerability has been reported to affect the atp.c, axnet_cs.c,
xirc2ps_cs.c and the rtl8139.c network device drivers for Linux variant
systems. Older NetApp systems using the 'Gigabit Ethernet Controller I'
are vulnerable to this issue.

Cisco has stated that the IOS 12.1 and 12.2 trains are not affected.

10. IPFilter TCP ACK/Bad Checksum Packet Denial Of Service Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6534
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6534
Summary:

IPFilter is a packet filtering implementation that is in wide use on a
variety of Unix systems.

IPFilter is prone to a denial of service when handling specially crafted
packets.

Normally when IPFilter handles a TCP ACK packet (without a previous SYN
packet to initiate the session), it will mark the session as
"TCPS_ESTABLISHED" in the state table.  The system will respond with a RST
packet and IPFilter will set the timeout for the session in the state
table to one minute.

However, when IPFilter handles this type of TCP ACK packet with a bad
checksum, it will add an "ESTABLISHED" session to its state table, which
will time out in 120 hours.

If numerous packets of this nature are sent, this may cause a denial of
service as the state table will be filled with these sessions.

This issue is known to occur when "keep state" rules are used without
"flags S".  The vendor advises users against employing this configuration.
It is possible to trigger this condition with other packet sequences.

11. Microsoft Windows Fontview Denial of Service Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6536
Remote: No
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6536
Summary:

Microsoft Windows uses fontview.exe as the default font viewer.

Windows is vulnerable to a denial of service condition when certain
malformed OpenType font files (.otf) are viewed with the default font
viewer.  Attempting to view the font file causes a page fault, resulting
in the system Blue Screening and rebooting.

Since this issue results in an invalid memory reference by the kernel,
there is a possibility that it may be exploitable to cause code execution,
however, this has not been confirmed.

The exact cause of this issue is not currently known, however, this record
will be updated if and when more details become available.

This vulnerability is reported to affect Windows 2000 and XP, but other
versions may also be affected.

12. H-Sphere Webshell flist() Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6538
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6538
Summary:

H-Sphere is a multiserver web hosting application. H-Sphere ships with
WebShell, a component designed to be a file manager for uploading
downloading files via FTP. H-Sphere is available for the Windows, Linux,
and Unix operating systems.

A remotely exploitable vulnerability has been discovered in H-Sphere. The
problem occurs in the flist() function used by the WebShell component. By
making a request for a directory name of excessive length, it may be
possible to overrun a buffer.

By exploiting this issue to overwrite sensitive locations in memory a
remote attacker would be able to control the program and possibly execute
arbitrary instructions.

13. S-PLUS For Unix Insecure Temporary File Vulnerabilities
BugTraq ID: 6530
Remote: No
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6530
Summary:

S-PLUS for Unix is statistical analysis software.

S-PLUS for Unix is prone to a number of insecure temporary file creation
vulnerabilities.  These issues exist in some of the S-PLUS Spqe binary and
various shell scripts.

S-PLUS creates temporary files using predictable names, which are derived
from the process ID (PID).  Additionally, when these files are created
symbolic links will be followed.  If the attacker can anticipate the names
of these temporary files, it is possible to lauch symbolic link attacks
which may result in file corruption.  The attacker must simply create a
symbolic link in place of one of the temporary files, and the symbolic
link must point to another file that is writeable by the user executing
one of the vulnerable S-PLUS utilities.

S-PLUS for Unix is prone to multiple instances of this vulnerability.

14. H-Sphere Webshell diskusage.cc Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6540
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 06 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6540
Summary:

H-Sphere is a multiserver web hosting application. H-Sphere ships with
WebShell, a component designed to be a file manager for uploading
downloading files via FTP. H-Sphere is available for the Windows, Linux,
and Unix operating systems.

A vulnerability has been discovered in H-Sphere Webshell. The problem
occurs due to insufficient bounds checking on user-supplied values.

The vulnerability occurs in the diskusage.cc file and can be triggered by
passing the target server an value of excessive length, of greater than
1024 characters, for the 'path' variable.

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow an attacker to overwrite
the vulnerable functions instruction pointer. By causing the program to
return to attacker-supplied instructions, it may be possible to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the target process.

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6531
Summary:

HTTP Fetcher is a small library used for downloading files via HTTP using
the GET method. It is available for various platforms including the Linux
and Unix operating systems.

Multiple buffer overflows have been discovered in HTTP Fetcher. The
vulnerabilities occur in the http_fetch() function which is used to gather
various HTTP header information. These buffer overflow occurs due to
insufficient bounds checking of user-supplied parameters.

It is possible to trigger these conditions by supplying excessive data as
the 'host', 'referer', or 'userAgent' parameters. By exploiting one of
these issues to overrun 'requestBuf', it may be possible for a remote
attacker to overwrite sensitive memory.

Successful exploitation of one of these vulnerabilities may allow an
attacker to seize control of an application linked to the library. By
overwriting the function's instruction pointer it may be possible to
execute arbitrary commands.

The exploitability of this issue may be an issue only if the client
application were accessible remotely through a proxy server. For instance,
a server which allowed a client to make GET requests from other servers.

Summary:

cgihtml is a series of CGI and HTML routines, implemented in C.  It can be
run on a number of platforms, including Unix and Linux variants and
Microsoft Windows.

A vulnerability has been discovered in cgihtml which may result in memory
corruption. The problem occurs when reading a user-supplied Content-Length
value for POST data.

An attacker is able to create a situation where memory may be overwritten
by passing a negative length as the Content-Length value in a POST
request. By passing excessive POST data it is possible for the attacker to
overrun the allocated buffer, effectively overwriting heap memory. This
may cause the affected program to crash.

Although not yet confirmed, it may be possible to exploit this
vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. Placing a malicious malloc header
in heap memory may potentially allow an attacker to overwrite a GOT
address to point to shellcode.

Summary:

cgihtml is a series of CGI and HTML routines, implemented in C.  It can be
run on a number of platforms, including Unix and Linux variants and
Microsoft Windows.

When handling uploaded form-data, cgihtml creates a temporary file to
store this data in /tmp or another user-specified directory.  The software
uses the client supplied filename when creating the temporary file.  If
the attacker supplies a malicious filename, such as one pre-pended with
dot-dot-slash (../) directory traversal sequences, it may be possible to
corrupt files outside of the specified temporary directory.

The cause of this issue trust in user-supplied input.  The routines use a
client-supplied filenames when creating temporary file.  The routines then
do not sufficiently validate that the filename does not contain directory
traversal sequences or has a name that may conflict with existing system
files.

For this attack to be successful, the targetted files must be writeable by
a server process that utilizes the vulnerable cgihtml routines.

29. CGIHTML Insecure Form-Data Temporary File Vulnerability

Summary:

cgihtml is a series of CGI and HTML routines, implemented in C.  It can be
run on a number of platforms, including Unix and Linux variants and
Microsoft Windows.

When handling uploaded form-data, cgihtml creates a temporary file to
store this data in /tmp or another user-specified directory.  A client
supplied filename is used when the temporary file is created.  This
presents a security vulnerability since the name of the temporary file can
be anticipated by the attacker.

A local attacker may take advantage of this condition to create a symbolic
link in place of the temporary file, which points to another file on the
system which is writeable by a server process which utilizes the
vulnerable routines.  The vulnerable routines will follow any symbolic
links provided in place of a temporary file.  The attacker may then submit
a malicious form-data upload, using the attacker-supplied filename, and
cause local files to be corrupted.

If custom data can be written to files, it is possible to gain elevated
privileges.

is available for Unix and Linux operating systems.

A problem with TANne may make it possible to execute arbitrary code.

Due to programming error, it may be possible to exploit a format string
vulnerability.  A logging function in the TANne program contains insecure
syslog() calls.  This could result in the execution of attacker-supplied
code.

The problem is the in two syslog() calls in the netzio.c source file.
When the program is invoked using the vulnerable function, it may be
possible to exploit a format string vulnerability through the generation
of a malicious log event which contains attacker-supplied format strings.
In the event that this vulnerability is exploited, an attacker could cause
arbitrary locations in memory to be corrupted with attacker-specified data
and execute code with the privileges of the TANne user.

project.  It is implemented in PHP and runs on a number of operating
systems, including Unix and Linux variants and Microsoft Windows operating
systems.

It has been reported that IMP is prone to multiple SQL injection
vulnerabilities.

IMP, in some cases, does not sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input
which is used when constructing SQL queries to execute on the underlying
database.  As a result, it is possible to manipulate SQL queries.  This
may allow a remote attacker to modify query logic or potentially corrupt
the database.  Consequences will vary depending on the queries used and
the capabilities of the underlying database implementation.

These issues occur throughout the database command files for different
database implementations, for example 'lib/db.pgsql'.  These files contain
syntax for constructing queries with using database implementations.

SQL injection attacks may also potentially be used to exploit latent
vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

A problem with ColdFusion MX Enterprise Edition may allow users to access
restricted files.

A vulnerability in the use of the cfinclude and cfmodule Tags exists in
ColdFusion MX.  In environments that are sandboxed, it may be possible for
a script to access files outside of the sandboxed directory.  This could
lead to unauthorized access to files on the host.

The problem is in the handling of relative paths.  Due to insufficient
checking of input in custom tags, it is possible to upload a file using
custom tags and containing relative paths that will access files outside
of a sandboxed directory.  This could allow an attacker to access
unauthorized and potentially sensitive information.

Summary:

WebIntelligence is an analysis tool for business intelligence.  It is
distributed by Business Objects, and available for the Unix and Microsoft
Windows platforms.

A problem with the WebIntelligence application could make it possible for
remote users to hijack sessions.

It has been reported that WebIntelligence uses an insecure model for
ensuring session security.  The application uses web-type security
features that may be prone to hijacking.  This could allow a remote user
to gain unauthorized access to another user's session.

The problem is that the application uses cookies with guessable values to
secure user sessions.  It has also been suggested that a remote attacker
may use other means to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from
legitimate users.  By gaining access to the application's session cookie,
another user could gain complete access to the user's session, and perform
all actions with the privileges of the victim.  This vulnerability however
does not permit the changing of user passwords.

FormMail is a web-based e-mail gateway, which allows form-based input to
be emailed to a specified user. It is written in Perl and will run on most
Linux and Unix variants, in addition to Microsoft Windows operating
systems.

FormMail is allegedly prone to cross-site scripting attacks.

The FormMail script does not sufficiently sanitize HTML tags and script
code from query strings, which in turn are output into pages generated by
the software.  As a result, a remote attacker may construct a malicious
link to the script which contains arbitrary script code.  If this link is
visited by a web user, the attacker-supplied script code may be
interpreted by their browser in the context of the site hosting the
software.

This may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication
credentials or manipulate web content.  Other attacks are also possible.

This issue was reported in FormMail 1.92.  Other versions may also be
affected.

Summary:

Mambo Site Server is a freely available, open source web content
management tool. It is written in PHP, and available for Unix, Linux, and
Microsoft Windows operating systems.

A problem with Mambo Site Server may make it possible for remote attackers
to upload files to a vulnerable system.

Due to inadequate security checks performed by some PHP scripts, an
attacker is able to upload arbitrary files to the system. The following
scripts have been reported to be vulnerable to this issue:
administrator/gallery/uploadimage.php administrator/upload.php upload.php

Specifically, the scripts only check to see whether certain image
extensions, such as '.jpg' and '.gif', exist in the filename. As such any
file that includes the allowed extensions may be uploaded. Any uploaded
files will be stored in the 'images/stories' directory on the system.

Given the ability to upload arbitrary files to the host, an attacker can
exploit this vulnerability to upload malicious applications to the
vulnerable system or use the system for the storage of files.

This vulnerability was reported for Mambo Site Server 4.0.12 BETA and

This vulnerability was reported to exist in WebCollection Plus version
5.00, but other versions may also be vulnerable.

42. BRS WebWeaver MKDir FTP Root Path Disclosure Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6576
Remote: No
Date Published: Jan 10 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6576
Summary:

BRS WebWeaver is an ftpd and webserver from Blaine Southam.

WebWeaver's FTP component has a flaw which can permit a remote user to
learn the physical path to the FTP service's root directory.

By submitting the FTP command mkdir argumented by a previously existing
directory, the attacker can cause an error message to be generated by
WebWeaver which includes the path for the FTP root.

Properly exploited, this information could assist a hostile user in
carrying out other attacks on the system.

43. Half-Life ClanMod Plugin Remote Format String Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6577
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 10 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6577
Summary:

Half-Life is commercially available game which may be played over a
network. 'rcon' authentication is given to users for various adminstrative
abilities on the server.

ClanMod is a plugin designed to offer extended features to Half-Life
server admins by providing an in-game menu system, scheduled tasks, custom
command and task declarations, specialized configs and addons to ease the
admin's task of administration.

A format string vulnerability has been discovered in ClanMod. It has been
reported that an rcon authenticated user may trigger this vulnerability
through the 'cm_log' command. This command is used to write messages to
the server log file. Due to insufficient format specifiers in a vfprintf()
call by the logging function, it is possible for an attacker to supply
their own format string.

By passing a vulnerable server malicious format specifiers it is possible
for an attacker to write to arbitrary locations in memory. This may allow
an attacker to overwrite the servers GOT entries or other sensitive data
which would allow the execution of malicious instructions.

44. Half-Life AdminMod Plugin Remote Format String Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6580
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 10 2003 12:00AM

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6580
Summary:

Half-Life is commercially available game which may be played over a
network. 'rcon' authentication is given to users for various adminstrative
abilities on the server.

A format string vulnerability has been discovered in the Half-Life
AdminMod plugin. The problem occurs in commands which call the
selfmessage() function, which is used by other functions to write a
message to the users console. The format string occurs when the
System_Response() function is called by selfmessage() to log the
administrative command. The following AdminMod commands are affected by
this issue:

admin_ban
admin_banip
admin_bury
admin_execclient
admin_gag
admin_godmode
admin_kick
admin_llama
admin_map
admin_noclip
admin_psay
admin_slap
admin_slay
admin_teleport
admin_unbury
admin_ungag
admin_unllama
admin_userorigin
admin_vote_kick
admin_vote_map

By passing a vulnerable server malicious format specifiers it is possible
for an 'rcon' authenticated attacker to write to arbitrary locations in
memory. This may allow an attacker to overwrite the servers GOT entries or
other sensitive data which would allow the execution of malicious
instructions.

45. Half-Life StatsMe Plug-in CMD_ARGV Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6575
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 10 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6575
Summary:

Half-Life is commercially available game which may be played over a
network.  StatsMe is a plug-in for Half-Life Dedicated Server which
provides game statistics.  'rcon' authentication is given to users for
various adminstrative abilities on the server.

The Half-Life StatsMe plug-in is prone to an exploitable buffer overflow
condition.  This issue may be exploited by an attacker who can
authenticate with the rcon-password of the Half-Life server to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the server process.

User-supplied input is stored in the CMD_ARGV variable and used in a
sscanf() operation, without any bounds checking.  As a result, it is
possible to corrupt memory (such as stack variables) with
attacker-supplied values.

Exploitation may be dependant on which other plug-ins are running on the
Half-Life server.  It has been reported that the "szBuffor" buffer has to
lie on an address with printable characters for exploitation to be
successful.

Successful exploitation will allow an attacker to gain local and possibly
privileged access to the host running the server.

46. Half-Life StatsMe Plug-in MakeStats Format String Vulnerability

authenticate with the rcon-password of the Half-Life server to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the server process.  This issue exists in
the MakeStats function in the 'statsme.cpp' source file.  The printf()
function is used without any format specifiers.  An attacker may exploit
this condition to overwrite arbitrary locations in memory with
attacker-supplied values, potentially resulting in execution of arbitrary
code.

Exploitation may be dependant on which other plug-ins are running on the
Half-Life server.  It has been reported that the "szBuffor" buffer has to

47. Half-Life HLTV Remote Denial Of Service Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6579
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 10 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6579
Summary:

Half-Life is commercially available game which may be played over a
network.  HLTV is the Half-Life TV component of the Half-Life Dedicated
Server (hlds).  It is available for the Linux operating system.

A problem with HLTV could make it possible for a remote user to deny
service to legitimate users.

It has been reported that under some circumstances, a remote user may
cause the service to crash.  By sending a specially crafted packet to the
host, the service becomes unstable.  The service must be manually
restarted to resume normal operation.

The problem is in the handling of specific types of requests from clients.
When an HLTV server receives a request of the string '\xff\xff\xff\xff\0'
the server crashes.  It is not know what impact this has on the operation
of the game server.

Versions other than hlds 3.1.1.0 may also be affected.

48. SCO UnixWare/Open UNIX PS Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6583
Remote: No
Date Published: Jan 10 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6583
Summary:

UnixWare and Open UNIX are operating systems distributed by SCO.

The SCO UnixWare/Open UNIX ps utility is prone to a locally exploitable
buffer overflow condition.

This issue is due to insufficient bounds checking of arguments in command
line options.  An attacker may invoke the utility with malformed
arguments, causing sensitive regions of memory to be corrupted with
attacker-supplied data.  This may allow an attacker to cause arbitrary
code to be executed.

While this utility is not installed setuid/setgid, it calls
procprivl(SETPRV,pm_work(P_MACREAD).  The procprivl() function may be used
to count, add, remove or put privileges associated with the calling
process.  Due to the use of this function, it may be possible to exploit
this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

49. Middleman net_dns() Frame Pointer Overwrite Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 6584
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 10 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6584
Summary:

Middleman is an HTTP/1.1 proxy server. It is available for the Linux and
Unix operating systems.

A vulnerability has been discovered in Middleman. The problem occurs when
the net_dns() function calls s_strncpy() during a DNS lookup of the
request server hostname. The s_strncpy() function is a wrapper for
strncpy(), designed to NULL terminate all copied strings. When the
s_strncpy() function is called on the requested host name of 128 bytes, a
NULL byte may be written to the least significant byte (LSB) of the
functions frame pointer (EBP). This issue occurs due to an incorrect
length parameter passed to s_strncpy().

Overwriting the least significant bit of EBP with a NULL byte may allow an
attacker to point the variable into user-supplied data. As EBP is copied
to the frames stack pointer (ESP), an attacker may trick the program into
referencing a malicious address as an instruction pointer. This will allow
an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the
vulnerable server, possibly root.

It should be noted that this issue may not occur on all systems. The
existance of this vulnerability may be highly dependant on compiler
optimization.

50. BRS WebWeaver MKDir Directory Traversal Weakness
BugTraq ID: 6585
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 10 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6585
Summary:

BRS WebWeaver is an ftpd and webserver from Blaine Southam.

WebWeaver's FTP component has a flaw which can permit a remote user to
create directories outside the FTP root.

By executing the mkdir command on an ftp server with dot-dot-slash (..\)
directory traversal notation, an attacker can create a directory outside
of the FTP root.

This weakness could possibly be used in combination with other
vulnerabilities to exploit a system for some gain, such as denial of
service or elevated privileges.  It should be noted that this weakness
will not allow users to clobber directories.

51. Bea Systems WebLogic ResourceAllocationException System Password Disclo=

BugTraq ID: 6586
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jan 11 2003 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6586
Summary:

BEA Systems WebLogic Server is an enterprise level web and wireless
application server for Microsoft Windows and most Unix and Linux
distributions.

A vulnerability in BEA Systems WebLogic Server may, under some
circumstances, result in the disclosure of system passwords if exceptions
are output.

BEA Systems has reported that WebLogic Server will throw an exception when
an application attempts to route a JMS message across a bridge and an
error occurs.  This exception will include the supplied system password,
in plaintext.

Applications that output exceptions may inadvertently disclose password
values.  This may ultimately result in a remote party gaining access to
affected systems.

6. Packetflow Firewall Generator v0.7
by pfrieden
Relevant URL:
http://packetflowfw.sourceforge.net/
Platforms: Os Independent
Summary:

PacketFlow Firewall Generator is an XML-based firewall generator. It takes
an XML configuration file that defines the firewall policy and generates a
list of iptables commands to implement this policy. It is primarily
intended for use on dedicated firewalls, but it can be used in other
scenarios. It makes dealing with many interfaces easy. PacketFlow works on
the concept of interface "security levels." New connections are allowed to
flow down hill from interfaces with a high security level to interfaces
with a low security level. This approach tends to make rule sets much
shorter, even with many interfaces. Access lists allow you to override the
default behavior of the security levels. Access lists are defined between
interfaces. There is also support for incoming, outgoing, and wildcard
access lists. Wildcard access lists allow you to easily allow new
connections to a particular service from any interface.
