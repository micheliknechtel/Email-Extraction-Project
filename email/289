From Oratorios to Elvis
Pop culture has been coming to a church near you for hundreds of 
years.
by Chris Armstrong

   Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis has entered the (church) building.

   Imagine a mutton-chop-whiskered, white-jump-suited Anglican 
   priest, posed dramatically on one knee, arm raised skyward, 
   belting out, before a cheering crowd of the pious and the 
   curious, the Elvis hit "Where Could I Go But to the Lord." 
   (Yes, Elvis covered that song in 1968. His Majesty is not in 
   the Gospel Hall of Fame for nothing--he garnered all three of 
   his Grammies for gospel hits, not rock tunes.)

   The priest then regales his riveted audience with Christian 
   rewrites of such secular Elvis perennials as "Blue Suede 
   Shoes" ("Well it's one for the Father, two for the Son, three 
   for the Holy Spirit and your life has just begun.")

   That's the Rev. Dorian Baxter--"Elvis Priestly," he likes to 
   be called. Last Sunday, January 5, Baxter held the inaugural 
   service of his "Christ the King, Grace-Land, Independent 
   Anglican Church" in a Newmarket, Ontario Legion Hall. Two 
   hundred potential members showed up, along with a bevy of 
   paparazzi.

   Baxter uses the hyphen in "Grace-Land" to emphasize "Grace." 
   (He also recognizes that the King lived a less than saintly 
   life, but he insists the rock'n'roll star held firmly 
   throughout his life to faith in Jesus and died with a pure 
   heart.)

   He uses the "Independent" because Canadian Anglican officials 
   have found his shtick "in poor taste," and demoted him to 
   "priest-on-leave" from the Diocese of Algoma in Sault Ste. 
   Marie, Ontario.

   This kind of reaction is a familiar one for those through the 
   centuries who have drawn on secular cultural forms in their 
   efforts to bring sinners from the world into the church.

This Week in Christian History

   January 10, 1739:
   George Whitefield, the preacher who sparked America's first 
   Great Awakening, is ordained to the Anglican ministry. 
   Whitefield took to open-air preaching after jealous ministers 
   denied him the use of their pulpits, and he was perfectly 
   suited to it--his booming voice, it was reported, could be 
   heard a mile away (see issue 38: George Whitefield).

   January 11, 1759:
   The first American life insurance company is incorporated in 
   Philadelphia--the "Corporation of Poor and Distressed 
   Presbyterian Ministers and of the Poor and Distressed Widows 
   and Children of Presbyterian Ministers."

   January 12, 1167:
   Aelred, the Anglo-Saxon abbot who became one of the Middle 
   Ages' best-known devotional writers, dies.

   January 13, 1501:
   Christianity's first vernacular hymnal is printed in Prague, 
   containing 89 hymns in Czech.

   January 14, 1892:
   Lutheran pastor and political activist Martin Niemoller, who 
   was imprisoned by Hitler for his leadership role in the 
   Confessing Church, is born (see issue 32: Dietrich 
   Bonhoeffer).

   January 15, 345 (traditional date):
   Paul of Thebes, traditionally considered the first Christian 
   hermit and an inspiration for Antony of Egypt and later 
   Christian monasticism, dies (see issue 64: Antony and the 
   Desert Fathers).

   January 16, 1920:
   Largely the result of Christian activists, the Eighteenth 
   Amendment to the U.S. Constitution goes into effect, 
   prohibiting the sale of alcohol. Thirteen years later, 
   Congress repealed the prohibition (see issue 55: The Monkey 
   Trial and the Rise of Fundamentalism).
