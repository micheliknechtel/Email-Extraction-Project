<p>Last week the Nasdaq faltered around the 1460 level and finished with a sharp sell-off on Friday.  By establishing a new peak that is lower than the peak that occurred at the beginning of December (~1520), the Nasdaq has failed to 
confirm the intermediate uptrend that it appeared to be establishing.  For charts and more details on this development, be sure to check out the "ChartWatchers" <a 
href="http://stockcharts.com/def/servlet/Favorites.CServlet?obj=public&cmd=show&disp=RED" target="scc">Public Chart list</a> on the web site.  A little later in this newsletter, John Murphy shares his intermarket insights as to why 
last week's rally faltered, but first...</p>
 
<center><b>What's Driving the Current Intermediate Term Rally?</b></center>
 
<p>Long time ChartWatchers know that two "hidden gems" here at StockCharts are our PerfChart performance tracking tool and our MarketCarpet visual scanning tool.  I want to show you how these tools can be used to gain more 
insights into what is behind the intermediate term rally that is currently underway.</p>
 
<p>The first step has always been to see what the market as a whole is doing.  Our "<a href="http://stockcharts.com/charts/performance/USMarkets.html" target="_new">Major Indices PerfChart</a>" compares 
percentage changes in each of the major indices and allows you to interactively change the range of dates used in the comparison.  Here's what that chart looks like currently:</p>
 
<center><a href="http://stockcharts.com/charts/performance/USMarkets.html" target="_new"><img src="http://stockcharts.com/commentary/archives/images/cww20030118-1.gif" border=0></a></center>
 
<p>Note that the lowest point for all of the indices occurred near the beginning of last October.  If you click on the chart above, you'll see a live version this PerfChart.  By dragging the left side of the slider at the bottom of 
the chart, you can then discover that October 9th was the day that the Nasdaq's bottom occurred.  You will also see that since then the Nasdaq has outperformed the other indices by almost 5%.</p>
 
<p>Let's see if we can spot any other significant trends that have happened since October 9th. The next stop is the <a href="http://stockcharts.com/charts/performance/MarketCap.html" target="_new">Market Capitalization 
PerfChart</a>.  It compares the performance of Small-Caps, Mid-Caps, and Large-Caps. Divergences in the performance of these three groups of stocks often provide valuable insights but, as you can see below, that isn't true right 
now:</p>
 
<center><a href="http://stockcharts.com/charts/performance/MarketCap.html" target="_new"><img src="http://stockcharts.com/commentary/archives/images/cww20030118-2.gif" border=0></a></center>
 
<p>Shoot. Because all of the lines have remained close together, this rally has not favored stocks by size so far.  We need to look elsewhere and the next stop is the S&P Select Sector SPDRs (pronounces "Spiders").  We use our SPDR 
PerfChart to see how the major sectors of the market are doing relative to each other.  The chart below shows the overall performance of each SPDR relative to the performance of the S&P 500 index for the period between October 9th 
and now.</p>
 
<center><a href="http://stockcharts.com/charts/performance/SPSectors.html" target="_new"><img src="http://stockcharts.com/commentary/archives/images/cww20030118-3.gif" border=0></a></center>
 
<p>Now we are getting somewhere.  Two sectors stand out - Technology and Utilities.  Unfortunately, as often happens in this business, this also opens up a whole new set of questions.  If Technology is truly the strongest sector, 
then - according to <a href="http://stockcharts.com/charts/performance/SPSectors.html#model" target="_new">Sam Stovall's Theory of Sector Rotation</a> - the economy really is coming out of the recession and good times are just 
around the corner.  If, on the other hand - Utilities are the strongest, then we still have a ways to go.</p>
 
<p>Obviously, the chart above gives conflicting messages.  We need to drill down into these two sectors using a different tool - our <a href="http://stockcharts.com/charts/carpet.html" target="_new">MarketCarpet tool</a> to be 
precise.  First, let's look at a snapshot of the percentage change in the individual stocks that make up the Sector SPDRs:</p>
 
<center><a href="http://stockcharts.com/charts/carpet.html" target="_new"><img src="http://stockcharts.com/commentary/archives/images/cww20030118-4.gif" border=0></a></center>
 
<p>Each square represents a stock. The "greener" the square, the bigger its percentage gain since October 9th.  The "redder" the square, the more it has lost. The sqaures are grouped into the various sectors with an overall average 
for the sector in the bar at the top of each group.  Note that the average percent gain for the stocks in the Utilities sector is +51.1% while the average percent gain for the Technology stocks is +45.2%.  Those numbers are 
pretty similar so, unfortunately, this carpet hasn't helped us too much.</p>
 
<p>Fortunately, the MarketCarpet has several other "modes" that we can use which can shed more light on things.  Instead of comparing the change in price for all of the stocks in these sectors, let's compare the change in a more 
complex technical indicator - specifically the RSI.  The RSI is a number that reflects the "internal strength" of a stock's movement. For all of the details, read our <a 
href="http://stockcharts.com/education/What/IndicatorAnalysis/indic_RSI.html" target="rsi">ChartSchool article on the RSI</a>. By changing the Market Carpet into RSI mode, we can see how the "internal strength" of the stocks in 
these two sectors has changed since October 9th. Here's a snapshot of that carpet:</p>
 
<center><a href="http://stockcharts.com/charts/carpet.html" target="_new"><img src="http://stockcharts.com/commentary/archives/images/cww20030118-5.gif" border=0></a></center>
 
<p>Now we see a big difference between the Technology sector and the Utilities sector!  On average, Utility stocks have had an increase of +24.6 points in their RSI readings since October 9th while the RSI values for stocks in the 
Technology sector have only increased +7.8 points.  This indicates that the Utility stocks have had more consistant gains recently with less volatility.  That in turn indicates that the gains shown by the Technology sector may be 
due more to their more volatile nature rather than due to rotational effects. (Note: I encourage you to switch the carpet into several other modes to study these sector differences further.)</p>
 
<p>The bottom line is that <b>both</b> sectors deserve everyone's attention right now.  If Utilities prove to be stronger, then the recession may not really be over however if technology stocks shake off their recent weakness and 
rebound, the worst really will be behind us.</p>

<tr><td id=content colspan=3><P><b>STOCK AND BOND TRADING RANGES...</b> It now appears that bonds and stocks have reached the extremes of their respective trading ranges -- stocks on the upside and bonds on the downside. On a short-term basis, that suggests 
that stocks should start to weaken while bond prices gain. Chart 1 shows the S&P moving to within 50 points of its fourth quarter high -- and its 200-day moving average. At the same time, Chart 2 shows Treasury bond prices starting 
to rally from chart support along its October low -- well above major support at its 200-day average. The bond chart is almost a perfect mirror image of the S&P chart.</P>

<P><b>WEAK ECONOMIC NEWS HURT DOLLAR...</b> The stock market rally, and the bond market selloff, have been predicated on a better economy -- and stronger corporate earnings. A batch of weak economic news this morning has 
shifted the pendulum away from an overbought stock market back toward an oversold bond market. A weak consumer sentiment number along with soft industrial production figures were released this morning. That hurt stocks and 
helped bonds. A record U.S. trade deficit also took a toll on the U.S. dollar, which fell sharply as a result. We also suggested at the start of the month that a weak dollar would prevent a major upmove in stocks -- but would be 
good for gold stocks. We still believe that new lows in the dollar imply a weak U.S. economy, which should be enough to prevent an upside breakout in stocks. Weaker than expected inflation numbers released this week were also 
troublesome -- since they reflected a continuing deflation threat.</P>
 
<center><img src="http://stockcharts.com/commentary/archives/images/cww20030118m-3.png"></center>
 
<p><b>PRICES REALLY ARE FALLING...</b> A negative PPI number of -0.3% was reported at midweek for December. According to the WSJ, core wholesale prices were down -0.4% for the year, the first time in 28 years that the U.S. 
has ended a year with annual declines in core wholesale prices. That's deflationary. Economists, however, took comfort in Thursday's small uptick in the Consumer Price Index. They used that to argue against the threat of 
deflation. However, an article in the WSJ this morning (CPI Reflects Big Split in Economy) argues that while service prices rose 3.2% in 2002, the price of "goods" actually fell 1.5%. The article also states that the combined drop in 
the cost of "goods" during November and December was the biggest drop in such prices on record going back to 1958. While the economists are focused on "inflation" in medical costs and college tuition, companies are being bled by 
"deflation" in manufactured goods. Despite the recent rise in commodity prices, the PPI and CPI numbers released this week show that deflation remains a very real threat to the economy and the stock market.</p>

<p><b>More Real-Time New</b><br>
We've gotten several questions about the nature of our upcoming real-time offering that I wanted to clarify for everyone. What we are talking about is simply removing the 20-minute delay from our SharpCharts. We are not talking 
about streaming charts or adding more ticker symbols or scrolling ticker windows or tick-by-tick charts.  On StockCharts, "Real-time" means that when you ask for a SharpChart of IBM, you'll see it with the most up-to-date 
information that we can provide. We are still hoping that this service will debut before the end of the month. Stay tuned...</p>

<tr><td id=content colspan=3>
<p>This is a set of indicators we developed from On Balance Volume (OBV) calculations for the individual stocks that compose a given market index, in this case the Nasdaq 100 Index.<br><br>
 
The Climactic Volume Indicator (CVI) measures extreme OBV moves inside a narrow envelope, and is a good measure of short-term overbought and oversold conditions. As you can see, the CVI was very oversold as of Friday's close, and 
considering there is also a price gap that needs filling, we'll probably see a price bounce on Tuesday or Wednesday.<br><br>
 
The Short-Term Volume Oscillator (STVO) is a 5-day moving average of the CVI, and it identifies more important short-term tops and bottoms. It is modestly oversold and would also support a short bounce.<br><br>
 
The Volume Trend Oscillator is a summary of OBV trends and has longer-term significance. After multiple overbought tops in December, it has recently formed another, yet lower, overbought top. It indicates that the recent price top 
is probably the start of an intermediate-term decline.</p>
