Please visit our website at http://www.cartoonwork.com to see two new 
cartoons.

Need design or illustration? Please visit 
http://www.estellegraphics.com. And you thought we only drew
funny pictures.......

Please note: We are hard at work on a major cartoon site redesign. We 
hope to have our "beta" version up for your comments and suggestions 
within about a month. It will have better organization, better 
navigation, a site search, and will include a basic shopping cart to 
make cartoon ordering easier. Stay tuned!

Take Action! Heavy truck builder Peterbilt locked out 750 members of UAW 
Local 1832 after their contract expired.  Since then, these workers have 
been scrambling to find  ways to feed their families. Peterbilt workers 
were told to accept a 300 percent increase in health care costs, a 600 
percent increase in prescription drug costs and a raise of just 22 cents 
an hour.  Visit  http://www.unionvoice.org/campaign/peterbilt and let 
Peterbilt know how you feel.

Thanks,

Estelle and Bob
