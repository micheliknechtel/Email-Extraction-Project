+ BIZ: Clooney's "Confessions" Swoons Audience Attendance, 
While "Chicago" "The Pianist," "About Schmidt" and "Talk 
to Her" Open Wider

George Clooney's directorial bow "Confessions of a Dangerous 
Mind" was a bang at the box office in its first full weekend,
while "The Pianist" expanded its screens and grosses in its 
second week and Miramax's "Chicago" jazzed up some big 
numbers. "About Schmidt" launched into wide release with 
hefty grosses. And, Almodovar's "Talk to Her" also opened in 
additional theaters to large audiences along with Denzel 
Washington's "Antwone Fisher."

Miramax's "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," which opened on 
New Year's Eve, took in $87,199 its first full weekend of 
release on four screens. The film, a subjective account of 
the life of "Gong Show" host Chuck Barris, crooned to the 
tune of $21,800 per screen and a $169,714 total. Roman 
Polanski's Holocaust drama "The Pianist," a Focus release 
starring Adrien Brody, added dozens of screens over the 
weekend, showing in 90 theaters with a $744,588 take for a 
grand $8,273 per-screen average and new cume just over the 
$1 million mark.

+ MOVIES: Smith Brothers Team Up for Sturdy "Slaughter Rule"

"The Slaughter Rule" is an engrossing, frequently brilliant 
first feature by twin brothers Andrew and Alex Smith. Here is 
the galvanizing corrective to a festival awash in miniature, 
depressingly ugly video works, a movie that reaches deep and 
wide to say something vital about the construction of 
masculinity, the quest for independence, and the nature of 
autonomy. 

The movie has some awkward passages, runs a little long, and 
contains an occasionally unstable story, but the scope of the 
brothers' imagination and their superb characterizations 
yield some deeply impressive revelations. Attempting a work 
both dense and allusive, the Smiths have taken a subcultural 
subject -- the sport of six-man football -- and crafted a 
story of immediacy and depth, thwarted ambition and 
recurring failure.
