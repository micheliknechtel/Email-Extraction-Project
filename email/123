* What's Happening
Eddie Murray and Gary Carter are the newest members of baseball's Hall of Fame. Murray, the only switch-hitter with 500 home runs and 3,000 hits, was elected today in his first year of eligibility, while Carter finally made it on his sixth try. No one else came close in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Carry-over candidates Bruce Sutter, Jim Rice and Andre Dawson were right around 50 percent, and first-timers Ryne Sandberg and Lee Smith didn't even reach that mark.
http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/news/2003/01/07/hall_voting_ap/

Is No. 3 Connecticut for real? We'll find out tonight when the Huskies travel to Oklahoma to try to snap the ninth-ranked Sooners' 29-game winning streak at Norman's Lloyd Noble Arena. At 9-0, UConn is one of just three unbeaten Division I basketball teams, but OU (8-2) will be the first ranked team the Huskies have faced. Last season, Oklahoma edged UConn 69-67 at the Hartford Civic Center.
http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/

The Portland Trail Blazers (20-12) try to hand the Phoenix Suns (21-13) consecutive losses for the first time in nearly a month when two of the NBA's hottest teams meet tonight in Portland's Rose Garden. Tied with the Blazers for second place in the Pacific Division, the Suns had won seven of eight before losing 101-97 to the Los Angeles Lakers on the road Sunday. Portland has won two in a row and 10 of 11.
http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/

The Toronto Maple Leafs (20-15-4-1) hope to extend their home unbeaten streak to 12 games tonight as they host the Boston Bruins (21-13-4-1). Toronto is 10-0-1 during the streak, which started with a 2-0 win over Boston on Nov. 19, when Ed Belfour posted his 60th career shutout. Belfour has added two more shutouts since then and is tied for the NHL lead with five.

* The Scoop
Field judge Terry Porter says he's getting a bad rap for his controversial pass interference call in the Fiesta Bowl, says Mike Fish.

* The Laundry List
The top 10 teams in CNNSI.com's College Basketball Power Rankings, with records and last week's rankings:
1.	Duke Blue Devils, 9-0 (3)
2.	Arizona Wildcats, 9-1 (5)
3.	Alabama Crimson Tide, 10-1 (1)
4.	Notre Dame Fighting Irish, 12-2 (4)
5.	Connecticut Huskies, 9-0 (8)
6.	Georgia Bulldogs, 9-3 (NR)
7.	Mississippi State Bulldogs, 10-1 (NR)
8.	Florida Gators, 11-2 (6)
9.	Pittsburgh Panthers, 11-1 (2)
10.	Wake Forest Demon Deacons, 9-0 (19)

* Fantasy Couch
His days of qualifying as a catcher are long gone, but Robert Fick figures to be a nice fit for the Atlanta Braves. Although he led the American League with 21 assists as the Detroit Tigers' right fielder last season, the 28-year-old Fick is slated to play first base in Atlanta. He gives the predominantly right-handed Braves a solid left-handed bat and shouldn't have any problem duplicating his .270 batting average, 17 home runs and 63 RBIs from 2002.

* Statitudes
200.3 million -- Wireless phone users in China. Houston Rockets center Yao Ming has signed a two-year endorsement contract with Sorrent Inc., which plans to develop the Yao Ming Basketball Game for mobile phones and other wireless devices in China.
http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/statitudes/


* They Said It
"Bummer." -- San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci, reacting to the NFL's admission that officials should have called pass interference on the final play of the 49ers' 39-38 playoff victory over New York, a penalty that would have given the Giants another chance to kick a game-winning field goal.


* The Sports Grill
Despite a major-league record 478 saves over 18 seasons, Lee Smith fell short his first bid to make the baseball Hall of Fame. In fact, just two relief pitchers have ever been elected to the Hall. Who are they? Answer: Hoyt Wilhelm (1985) and Rollie Fingers (1992).


* Mail Call
Will Paul Pierce, Ben Wallace, Baron Davis and Jermaine O'Neal be given a second chance to play for Team USA in 2004?
-- Mark Ong, Marikina City, Philippines

Wallace still has a shot, but don't look for any of the other three to be part of the '04 Olympic team. Pierce and Davis had issues with coach George Karl during last summer's World Championships. O'Neal didn't play badly, but his poor free throw shooting and overall youth make him a longshot this time around. The feeling around USA Basketball is that the next Olympic team needs all-around players who also will work together as a team. Wallace could be added as one of the team's three "role" players, but if Kobe Bryant, Jason Kidd, Tracy McGrady, Tim Duncan, Ray Allen, Gary Payton and Kevin Garnett choose to play, those other guys can make summer vacation plans.
-- Marty Burns


* Fouled Off
Sadly, unruly fans rushing the field or court have become as common as "Joe Millionaire" promos. But the problem is so bad for a Romanian soccer team that the owner is planning to install a moat around the pitch -- filled with crocodiles. "This is not a joke," insisted Alexandra Cringus, whose Steaua Nicolae Balcescu have been threatened with expulsion from their league because of repeated pitch invasions. "We can get crocodiles easy enough and feed them on meat from the local abattoir. The ditch is planned to be wide enough that no one could manage to jump over it. Anyone who attempted to do so would have to deal with the crocs. I think that the problem of fans running onto the pitch will be solved once and for all." Well, you probably wouldn't have many repeat offenders.
