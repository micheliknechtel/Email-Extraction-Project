1. Ad Technology Vendors: Despite Benefits, Managing Control and Clutter
Issues Is Key

Rich media is becoming a larger and more important portion of a brand's
online advertising plan. Several ad technology vendors have emerged over the
past several years with offerings designed to make creating, trafficking,
and measuring rich media ads easier and more cost-effective.

Key Questions
What market factors drive growth in the ad technology vendor market?
How can advertisers gain the benefits of ad technology solutions; what do
they need to be mindful of?

2. Next Generation Web Applications

Recent talk of next-generation "smart" clients and Web services - enabled
"rich client" experiences prematurely anticipate reinventing networked
desktop software in lieu of the ubiquitous Web browser. This vision skips
the next logical step.

Key Questions
What client-side technologies can site operators leverage to enhance user
experience?
Under what circumstances should organizations push the client-side envelope?
How will client-side interactivity evolve over the next three years?

3. Classifieds Advertising in Australia: Rivers of Gold Begin to Trickle
Online

Classifieds advertising has begun to migrate online in Australia, yet the
lack of pricing power means the disparity between usage and
commercialization will remain.

Key Questions
What is the size of the online classifieds advertising market in Australia?
Why have certain categories moved online faster than others have?
What part will bundling play in the development of various classifieds
sectors?
