I.      New Freebies & Deals

to the Free Things for Educators website.   All of these offers were 
added on January 16th.   After each offer, I have listed the Grade Level

found.  (If no grade level is listed, it can be found on any of the 
grade level pages).  The countries that each offer is available for are 
also listed.  If no country is listed, the offer is available 
internationally (to the best of my knowledge).

absolutely no control over this.  The individual web sites & companies 
are the ones that set up the guidelines for their own promotions.  So, 
if you see something you like or can use, take advantage of the offer 
while you can!  Please be responsible, though, and only order what you 
need.

To say 'thank you' to all of my wonderful newsletter subscribers, I want 
to share some more offers with you.  These offers will not be posted on 
the Free Things for Educators web site until a later date (unless they 
expire first!), so you have a definite advantage over non-subscribers!

I'm back!  I was gone on winter vacation, but now I am back and going 
full-steam ahead with the Free Things for Educators website!  I want to 
thank everyone who wrote to me and told me how much they were missing 
the regular updates during the past few weeks.  It really means a lot to 
me, knowing that educators everywhere really do benefit from this 
website.  

I hope everyone had a great vacation.  My family and I left our home in 
the Sunshine State to take a vacation in the snow and mountains.  We had 
a wonderful time snowboarding, ice skating, and enjoying all of the 
other winter activities that we normally miss out on.  I am finally 
getting settled back into my normal routine, so the updates should 
continue as normal.

Have a great week,
Kimberly
