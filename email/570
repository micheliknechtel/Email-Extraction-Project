QUOTE OF THE WEEK
---------------------
"That's right, dear Fool; I've coined a metric to help us invest
time more Foolishly. It's called ROIT (Return on Invested Time)
and pronounced 'royt.' The cool thing is, it will not only help
you invest time more Foolishly but also make you sound like a
feisty Englishman using a synonym for the word 'correct.'"

WEEKEND WARRIOR
---------------------
SHOPPING TIPS FOR INVESTORS
It's not that men hate to shop -- it's that men hate the way
women shop. Author Amanda Ford makes that enlightened
observation in her guidebook, Retail Therapy: Life Lessons
Learned While Shopping.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=800083

She goes on to detail how shopping has taught her some life
skills that she uses to better manage her relationships,
employment, and whatever life serves. But I've discovered a
handful of lessons, too -- ones men should consider applying to
the way they invest. After all, what's a mall if not a
real-world economics classroom?

RULE NO. 1: NOTHING BEATS IN-PERSON RESEARCH
Do you own a few retail stocks? Accompany your honey to the
mall for some live, in-person research. Abercrombie & Fitch
(NYSE: ANF), Ann Taylor (NYSE: ANN), Gap (NYSE: GPS) -- all are
publicly traded companies and usually positioned within a
stone's throw of one another at your local econosphere. Note to
which stores women and teenagers flock. Are the displays tidy
and the help courteous? Or has management given training the
short shrift in pursuit of higher profit margins?
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=800084
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=800085
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=800086

This kind of research cannot be as easily gleaned from the
black-and-white pages of a company's 10-Q (no pictures!). So
grab a half-caf latte, sit patiently on the bench outside the
stores, and observe.

RULE NO. 2: LEARN TO HUNT... FROM A WOMAN
Women as gatherers? Bah. As our species has evolved, the
hunting instinct of the fairer sex has been honed. And with the
supersizing of malls, it only gets stronger. We don't blench at
the idea of searching a two-mile stretch of stores for the
perfect size-8 pump with a faux tortoise buckle.

Likewise, in the financial world, women are known to be more
exacting when researching investments and less prone to impulse
stock purchases. When we do find a ten-bagger or the perfect
black dress, we can do a touchdown dance that would make a
seasoned NFL pro blush.

RULE NO. 3: PRACTICE THE ART OF DENIAL
Just because you research a hot stock doesn't mean you'll
automatically buy it, right? Hunting and gathering don't always
result in an acquisition.

Denial is a powerful tool. It requires just as much resolve as
the hunt. Knowing we can manhandle cashmere sweater sets and
butter-soft leather pants, yet not feel compelled to buy (because
you know the price isn't right or the fashion will soon fade) is
true empowerment. Just try doing that after test-driving the
Xbox. You'll see.

Also, by not buying something, we manage to actually save money.
Which leads to Rule No. 4....

RULE NO. 4: USE SHOPPING MATH
Unlike the metric system and Algebra Trig, markdown math should
be added to our national school curriculums. For example, I was
recently standing in line to return a $39.99 skirt at Ann Taylor
Loft. The line was three-deep, and of course, those in front of
me had complicated transactions, such as exchanging a pair of
sunglasses. Right next to the register were neatly stacked piles
of sweaters. Lo and behold, the perfect, irresistible black
cowlneck -- on sale! After the exchange, I was $10 in the black!

please see Advanced Accounting for Personal Gain.]
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=800087

RULE NO. 5: THINK LONG TERM
This is an oldie but a goodie. If you've experienced the pain --
the physical pain -- of watching one of your investments hit the
skids, at some point, you hopefully realized that if you could
endure the short-term discomfort, there could be a long-term
payoff. So it goes with holiday sales. Enduring crowds, long
lines, and terse help are a short-term pain in the keister, but
think of the long-term benefits.

See what can happen if you're willing to make a trip to the
mall? The next time your sweetie suggests you accompany her to
the store for "just a few things," play along and pay attention.
You just might learn something.
