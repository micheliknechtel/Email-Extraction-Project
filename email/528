4/Jan/03

I am a 42 year old female, very active & started into Pre-menopause as of 1 
year ago. I am totally into natural herbs & exercise during this part of my 
life.
Taking multi vits, extra calcium, vitex, primrose oil etc. Finally getting 
down 1 glass of soy milk each day. Trying to eat better of fruits & vegs, I 
put soy nuts into a few dishes but don't seem to be doing that on a daily 
basis.
My question is, what types of other foods can I get my Soy source from.  
What else should I be doing to replace what my body is needing ?

Thanks,

Ann

Subject: Hair Loss and Anemia

I am a 43 year-old woman who is experiencing hair loss in the front, top part 
of her hair line. Some of the oils I use are helping a bit but not much or 
fast. Is anyone using something that they feel helped them. I also suffer 
with anemia and have found the iron tablets my doctor suggested are too 
strong for my stomach. Any suggestions would be appreciated. 
Happy New Year,
Cheryl (MD)
