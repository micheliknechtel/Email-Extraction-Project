<p><a name="Headline1"><b><font color="#00008B">TOBACCO SUIT SEEKS CALIFORNIA AD STOPPAGE</font></b></a></p>



<p>NEW YORK - Tobacco companies R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Lorillard
Tobacco Co. said today they have a filed a lawsuit against the state of
California to stop state-sponsored ads the cigarette makers claim "exceed
the state's authority and are intended to vilify the tobacco industry."</p>



<p>R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard filed the suit in U.S. District Court in
Sacramento seeking an injunction to halt some of California's advertising
using tax dollars collected under the California Tobacco Tax and Health
Promotion Act, or Proposition 99, which was passed in 1988. Proposition 99
imposed a 25-cent tax on each pack of cigarettes sold in California. The
tax revenue was earmarked for tobacco-related disease research, health
education and health care for medically indigent families, according to
the California attorney general's office.</p>



<p>California Attorney General Bill Lockyer had not yet issued a statement on
the lawsuit at the time of this Newsletter.</P>



<p>The companies argue that "many of the state's ads misuse taxpayer funds,
violate the companies' constitutional rights and have a prejudicial effect
on potential jurors in lawsuits related to smoking." The suit targets
radio, TV, billboard and print ads.</P>



<p>"Reynolds Tobacco and Lorillard have no objection to ads intended for
tobacco-related health education," Daniel Donahue, deputy general counsel
for Reynolds Tobacco, said in a statement. "However, the state of
California has taken it upon itself to essentially re-write Prop 99 and
direct taxpayer dollars for uses the voters did not approve; namely, to
attack legitimate businesses and their employees rather than provide
tobacco-related health education."</P>

<p>NEW YORK - Dr Pepper/Seven Up brand A&W Root Beer has signed Jim Belushi,
star of ABC's <I>According to Jim</I>, to serve as spokesperson for a national
outdoor cooking contest, "From Alabama to Wyoming, Who Throws the Best
All-American Cookout?" The contest runs through June 30, 2003.</p>



<p>The contest asks consumers to submit their "ultimate party plans" for an
all-American cookout for the chance to be among the five finalists who
will receive $5,000 to throw their version of the All-American cookout.
Belushi, a self-described outdoor cooking aficionado, will appear in
marketing and will help A&W representatives select a winner. Media and
online will support.</p>



<p>The grand prize winner also will be the honorary guest for a private
concert at the House of Blues in Los Angeles on Sept. 4 where Belushi &
The Sacred Hearts will perform. In addition, Belushi is working with A&W

states that best represent their state's signature "cookout" dish.</P>



<p>"Americans love to cook outdoors, including me," Belushi said in a
statement. "Back home in Chicago, there were many times I cooked outdoors
in a parka and gloves. Barbecue is a way of life." Information is
available at Rootbeer.com.</P>

<p><a name="Headline4"><b><font color="#00008B">CONSUMERS WILL MAINTAIN H&B SPEND DURING WAR</font></b></a></p>



<p>NEW YORK - Many consumers are scaling back spending on discretionary items
due to factors ranging from rising gas prices to war worries, but are
least likely to alter spending this spring on products affecting their
appearance, such as cosmetics, skincare and apparel.</P>



<p>According to the just-released Consumer Buying Survey from market
information company The NPD Group, Port Washington, N.Y., 76% of consumers
said they are "being careful" about their discretionary spending and 41%
said they plan to spend less than usual over the next three months.
However, of the 17 product categories tracked in the NPD survey, health
and beauty held up the strongest, with 55% of those surveyed saying they
intend to spend the "same as usual" on cosmetics and skincare products
over the next three months.</P>



<P>In addition, 46% said they plan to spend the "same as usual" on
shoes/athletic footwear, while 45% plan to spend the "same as usual" on
apparel. However, toys/games, video games and small kitchen appliances
fared worst in the survey, with fewer than 40% of consumers saying they
would spend the "same as usual" in the three respective categories.</P>



<p>"Now more than ever, men and women of all ages want to look and feel good
and they're not willing to give this up even during times of instability
and war," Timra Carlson, president, NPD Beauty division of The NPD Group,
said in a statement. "Consumers will continue to pay for prestige makeup
and skincare products. However we have found that economic cycles will
affect fragrance sales." The NPD Consumer Buying Survey was conducted
March 4-11, 2003.</P>
