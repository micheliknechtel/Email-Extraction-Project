Whale Song

The whales are singing off Maui, and you're invited to the concert as
Whalesong.net presents live broadcasts of humpback whale vocalizations via
a listening system set up off the Hawaiian Islands.

The volunteer effort "gives a microphone" to marine mammals to bring
attention to the threats of high-powered sonar systems, military
technologies and undersea explosions, not to mention global warning, toxic
dumping and commercial whaling. To us, it's an awesome performance, but to
the whales and dolphins it's a means of navigating and communicating across
vast underwater spaces. Hear the beautiful, eerie live sounds or recordings
from last season, and read about how a beacon transmitter rigged up on a
floating platform captures these mysterious, marvelous songs of the sea.

Human Anatomy Online

If you get your pituitary gland confused with your adenoids - and who
doesn't - click on over to Inner Body for a straightforward explanation of
what's connected to what inside your own bad self.

Created by MyHealthScore.com, the group committed to helping consumers
navigate the perilous waters of health care, the site makes learning easy
by using the simple logic of point-and-click to guide visitors around and
inside human anatomy. Click on an image for the skeletal system or the
urinary tract, for example, then pick a point to zoom in on a new image and
read about the body part or system you've selected.

This Is SportsCenter

Serious sports wonks with a sense of fun have tuned to SportsCenter since
1979 when it was launched as ESPN's flagship show. Catch up with how much
sports and the program have changed at the 25,000th show celebration at
SportsCenter 25K, from ESPN.com.

See the top 25 SC stories of all time, like Kenny Mayne and Dan Patrick's
goofy top-rated commercial, "Go Global with SportsCenter." Read entries
from winners of the "Why do you love SportsCenter?" contest ("When my
girlfriend dumped me at one in the morning, my friends were drunk, my
parents were asleep ... SportsCenter was there."), link to the ESPN auction
to bring home an authentic SportsCenter desk and check out the SportsCenter
Chronology.

SHORT TAKES

Videogame Music Archive

Relax with the piano collections from Final Fantasy or the deathmatch music
from Quantum Rage at the Videogame Music Archive Store, where gamers can
download and play or find and purchase the music that soothes or
stimulates, whether you play Nintendo, Sega, X-Box or arcade games.

Fighting the Common Cold

You may not be able to beat the common cold, but you can sure put up a good
fight with help from Common Cold. org, a comprehensive, updated source of
info by two docs from the University of Virginia School of Medicine who
tell visitors how to treat, prevent and understand their winter sniffles.

Web Wheels

They don't call them "vanity" plates for nothing. At the Internet License
Plate Gallery, web types with license plates like "NET DUDE" who aren't
satisfied showing their plates only to other drivers can post their plates
online, along with their name and e-mail address, car description and a bit
about how they came up with the code.

New Wonders of the World

Just when you thought you had the old Seven Wonders of the World memorized,
New 7 Wonders.com invites citizens of the world to elect a new bunch of
wonders.

It has been over 2,000 years, after all, we are on the threshold of the
third millennium, and we do have a new global consciousness. Are the
Hanging Gardens of Babylon old news? The Temple of Artemis dated? Check out
the current ballot, with new entries like the Sydney Opera House, see how
the contestants stack up so far and mark your X on the symbols of
civilization that will be held in the highest esteem for the next 2,000 years.

A Walk Through Time

 From the movements of celestial bodies through the night sky to the Global
Positioning System, humans have been obsessed with tools for measuring
time. And no one is more obsessed than the folks at the NIST Physics
Laboratory, creators of The Evolution of Time Measurement Through the Ages.

Ice-age hunters over 20,000 years ago scratched lines and gouged holes in
bones to keep track of passing moments, Egyptians used obelisks as early as
3500 BC, and in 1656 a Dutch scientist made the first pendulum clock. Read
about the instruments and theories of timekeeping from the ancients to the
NIST's most recent achievement - a primary cesium standard, capable of
keeping time to 30 billionths of a second per year.

Best Inventions for 2002

Necessity may be the mother of invention, but who said we needed water
repellent cashmere or skis that carry a computer chip to monitor snow
conditions? It's the start of a new year, and Time.com looks back at the
past year's contrivances and contraptions at 2002 Best Inventions.

In categories from transit and talk to home and safety, Time looks at 40 or
so bright ideas. Some seem frivolous, like Cindy Smart, a doll who responds
to 70 preprogrammed questions and reads flash cards. But others are dead
serious, like the cardboard drink coaster that identifies the presence of
date-rape drugs, and plant-derived vaccines that may someday protect
against the world's most devastating diseases.

World City Photos

Rise above it all and view the world from on top at World City Photos.org,
offering more than 7,500 aerial photos and skyline views, including 4,500
cities from Kabul, Afghanistan to Lusaka, Zambia.

The site's creator started the collection as a personal hobby in 1994,
collecting aerial photos, adding some of his own and inviting people to
send in their tall shots for posting. The result is a huge archive, simply
indexed. Tallest Structures shows observation towers, skyscrapers and other
human-supporting structures with location and pinnacle height noted, like
the 537-meter Ostankino Tower in Moscow. Other notable landmarks
include  monuments, churches and temples, from San Francisco's Alcatraz to
the water towers in Kuwait City.

Tiger Homes

Lions and tigers and lemurs, oh my! Cats are king at Tiger Homes.org, a
private real world and online sanctuary for the great and gorgeous felines
of the wild. See Siberian tigers feeding, lions lounging and lemurs leaping
into their keepers' arms via several web cams placed in the animals' habitats.

Visitors can read about the personalities of the Siberians -- Tundra, Loki,
Clarence and Gypsy -- or Durango and the other lemurs and see them growing
up, playing and living large in the photo gallery. Sanctuary Chronicles
tell what's new, and the Educational Center gives plenty of learning
material, like a clickable world map that shows the habits, range and
physical characteristics of the beasts that still remain in the wild.
