THIS WEEK'S RECIPES
=========================

CHICKEN AND CELLOPHANE NOODLE SOUP

Yield: 4 servings

INGREDIENTS

-  1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  1 clove garlic
-  1 shallot, thinly sliced
-  5 cups fresh chicken stock or store bought low-sodium chicken broth
-  2 cups water
-  1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast
-  2 ounces cellophane noodles, soaked in water for 30 minutes,
   drained and cut into 12-inch strands
-  4 dried wood-ear mushrooms, soaked in hot water 30 minutes,
   woody stems discarded and cut into 2 to 3 pieces, if large
-  1-1/2 tablespoons fish sauce
-  2 teaspoons sugar
-  1 cup chopped baby bok choy or spinach
-  2 scallions, cut into thin rings
-  3 tablespoons chopped cilantro
-  Freshly ground black pepper

DIRECTIONS

Heat the oil in a large pot over moderate heat. Add the garlic and
shallot and stir until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Add the chicken
broth and water and bring to a boil. Add the chicken breast and
cook until just done, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool.

Add the cellophane noodles, mushrooms, fish sauce and sugar. Reduce
the heat to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the bok choy.

Hand-shred the chicken into bite-sized strips. Using chopsticks or
tongs, divide the noodles among 4 preheated bowls and ladle broth
over them. Place some chicken on top, then garnish with the
scallions, cilantro and black pepper. Serve immediately.

----------------------

CUCUMBER SALAD

Yield: 4 servings

INGREDIENTS

-  1/4 cup rice or distilled white vinegar
-  1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
-  3 tablespoons sugar
-  1/2 teaspoon salt
-  6 pickling cucumbers, halved
   and cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices (about 2-1/2 cups)
-  2 shallots, thinly sliced
-  1/2 serrano or other fresh chili, sliced (optional)
-  6 sprigs cilantro, chopped

DIRECTIONS

Combine the vinegar, lime juice, sugar and salt in a bowl. Stir
well and add the cucumbers, shallots, chili, if using, and cilantro.
Set aside to stand for 15 minutes, then transfer to a bowl to serve.

----------------------

TWICE-COOKED EGGPLANT WITH GARLIC AND BASIL

Yield: 4 servings as a side dish

INGREDIENTS

-  Vegetable oil
-  2/3 pound Asian eggplant, preferably the small dark-purple
   variety, cut on the diagonal into 2/3-inch-thick slices
-  2 cloves garlic, chopped
-  1 shallot, thinly sliced
-  3 Thai bird chilies or 1 serrano chili, chopped, or to taste
-  2/3 cup Asian basil leaves, roughly torn
-  6 ounces tofu, drained and cut into 2/3-inch cubes

-  1 tablespoon soy sauce
-  1/3 cup water

DIRECTIONS

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over high heat and swirl to
coat the entire surface. Add the eggplant slices in one layer
(work in batches if necessary) and sear briefly on both sides,
about 1 to 2 minutes total. Do not cook completely. Drain on paper
towels and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining eggplant, adding
more oil as necessary.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a pan over high heat. Add the garlic,
shallot, chilies, one third of the basil, tofu, mushroom sauce
and soy sauce and stir gently until fragrant, the sauce is
slightly reduced, another 3 to 4 minutes.

Add the eggplant slices and the remaining basil leaves and stir
until the vegetables are thoroughly hot. Quickly transfer to a
platter and serve immediately.

-------------------

LYCHEE SORBET

Yield: 1 quart

INGREDIENTS

-  5 (20-ounce) cans lychees in heavy syrup, drained, juice reserved
-  1/3 cup sugar
-  2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

DIRECTIONS

Measure 1/3 cup of the lychee syrup and set aside. Drain the
lychees (save the extra syrup to flavor iced tea or to drink).

Combine the 1/3 cup reserved syrup and sugar in a small saucepan
and heat until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and set
aside until ready to use.

Place the lychees in a fruit blender and process as fine as possible.
Add the syrup mixture and lemon juice and process for 1 minute.
Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Using
the back of a spoon, mash the fruit to extract as much juice as
possible. Cover the lychee mixture and refrigerate for at least
4 hours. Transfer to an ice-cream maker and freeze according to
the manufacturer's instructions.

KITCHEN TIPS, HEALTHFUL
HINTS, AND TASTY TIDBITS
=========================

Tomatoes may be the most widely available source of lycopene, but
they’re certainly not the only one. The red/pink color of fruit
like watermelon, guava and red or pink grapefruit is the sign that
lycopene is present. Lycopene is a natural antioxidant that can
neutralize unstable molecules which might otherwise damage our
cells. Several studies link greater consumption of foods high
in lycopene with lower risk of prostate and possibly other cancers,
although more research is needed before firm conclusions can be
made. Lycopene is available in supplements, but they are not
recommended at this time. Research on possible benefits only
involves lycopene in food.
------------------------------

White, milk and dark chocolate are all very similar in their
calories, total and saturated fat, protein and carbohydrate.
White chocolate contains no caffeine, whereas milk chocolate may
contain 1-15 milligrams (mg) per ounce (less than in a cup of tea),
and dark chocolate may contain 5–35 mg per ounce. Potentially
healthful antioxidants have been found in regular chocolate,
with highest levels in the dark types. Standards set last year
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) define white chocolate
as made from cocoa butter, milk solids, sweetening agents and
other safe and suitable ingredients, but no non-fat cacao solids.
These rules don’t become mandatory until January 2004 so, for now,
products made with vegetable fat instead of cocoa butter can still
be called white chocolate. Starting next year, they will need to
be called confectionary or summer coating.
------------------------------

Probiotics are live bacteria that, when taken in adequate amounts,
offer some sort of health benefit. They supplement the trillions
of bacteria always carried in our body, mostly in our colon that
prime our immune system and fight off illness-producing bacteria.
The most common probiotics in the U.S. are Lactobacillus and
Bifidobacteria. Acidophilus milk, yogurt labeled "with active
yogurt cultures," and kefir are probably the most common food
sources of probiotics. A variety of supplemental forms are also
available, but consumers must be careful to buy from reputable
companies. Well-documented research has shown that probiotic
bacteria can help lactose-intolerant people better digest dairy
products and prevent or treat certain intestinal diarrhea-producing
infections. They may also help with allergic responses like atopic
dermatitis or eczema, and reduce certain respiratory infections in
children. Claims have also been made for other possible benefits,
like reducing colon tumors and intestinal disorders, but such
findings are far from confirmed at this time. Beware of
misrepresentation by some books or products; probiotics are
sources of healthful bacteria, not vitamins or other nutrients.
------------------------------

Both graham cracker and traditional piecrusts vary tremendously in
the amount of fat used to make them. Some pre-made frozen crusts
are relatively low in fat because the amount of fat is minimized
and the crusts are rolled extremely thin. A traditional recipe
may have 120 calories and 8 grams of fat per slice of pie in the
crust alone. Graham or wafer cookie crumb crusts can often be made
with a healthier soft margarine instead of the solid shortening
used in most traditional piecrust dough. But the fat content will
vary depending on the recipe, and the calorie content may be
slightly higher than dough crusts because of the sweet crumbs
used. When baking such a crust, try to avoid solid shortening.

FEATURE ARTICLE:
=========================

DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU EAT?

"How did I get into this mess?" It’s a dilemma many people face today.
They’re not happy with their weight, fitness, blood cholesterol, or
overall health and energy, but they’re not sure how they got there.
Studies show that most people don’t have an accurate view of their
eating habits. The right kind of record-keeping can often supply
people with the answers like nothing else can.

If your weight has been creeping (or leaping) upward and you’re not
sure why, keeping a record of everything you eat and drink may help
spot the problem. But if a record’s going to do you any good, it
has to be accurate, and that can be challenging. The good news is
you don’t need to keep a record for weeks on end; studies show
that a well-kept record for just three typical days is not improved
by continuing.

To get the accuracy you need, keep track of everything as you go
through the day. When people try to fill in a record by memory at
the end of the day, they always forget valuable details. Most of
the time, it’s important to note not just what you eat and drink,
but the particulars of how it’s fixed or flavored. Fried? Topped
with melted cheese? Regular or fat-free dressing?

Portion size is also key. If you just write down what you consume
but not the amounts, you may be missing half (or more) of the
problem. Studies show that most people tend to underestimate
the amount they eat. A recent study in the Journal of the American
Dietetic Association showed that even dietitians’ food records
underestimated their true caloric intake. These professionals,
experienced and at least somewhat interested in keeping food
records, had reported an average of a little over 200 calories a
day below actual intake. Dieticians of comparable age and weight,
however, underreported their calorie intake by more than 400
calories a day.

You don’t need to carry measuring cups everywhere for three days,
but if you’re guessing at portion size, studies show that your
accuracy will suffer. This gap between guessing and reality won’t
help. Instead of guessing, the American Institute for Cancer
Research (AICR) recommends taking a few minutes at home to measure
out some standard serving sizes, like one cup of cereal or pasta,
for example, and take a good look at it, comparing it to the usual
portion you’ve been eating. You don’t have to use measuring cups
to get a fair approximation of standard servings. An average adult
fist is roughly equal to one cup, a deck of cards or computer mouse
for a three-ounce portion of meat, and four dice about equal to the
size of one ounce of cheese.

You may not need to keep a record of everything that passes your
lips. If you are already aware of a habit that may be key, you can
simply keep a record of that. If you are struggling to meet the
goal of five to ten daily servings of fruits and vegetables, as
advised by health experts, you might just keep track of your
produce consumption. If you suspect snacking is your downfall,
just write down what you eat and drink between meals. You might
even mark a "B," "S," or "H" next to each one to indicate whether
you snacked out of boredom, stress, or true hunger. If you have a
vague suspicion that you don’t take that lunchtime walk as often
as you intended, keep track of physical activity.

Depending on how frequently it occurs, keeping track of a specific
behavior may require about 10 days to give you an accurate picture.
Avoid guilt and perfectionism; focus on trying to really understand
your current habits. For some people, rather than focusing on their
less-healthy choices, keeping track of on-target behavior better
fosters the "can do" attitude necessary for successful change.
