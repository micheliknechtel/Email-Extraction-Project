BUSH TOUTS $670 BILLION TAX-CUT PLAN

WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- President Bush unveiled a $670 billion "growth
and jobs plan" Tuesday centered on eliminating taxes that shareholders
pay on corporate dividends while also accelerating income tax rate cuts,
raising the child-care tax credit and providing funds to help the
unemployed with retraining.

MARKET SNAPSHOT: BLUE CHIPS FAIL TO HOLD GAINS AFTER BUSH ECON PLAN

plan, but technology stocks stood their ground on the back of storage
company EMC's improved outlook.

LONDON CALLING: WEAKER DOLLAR IMPACTS: AHOLD AND MORE

LONDON (CBS.MW) - When the dollar weakens - and it has depreciated
significantly vs. the euro - it seems easy enough to expect U.S. export
stocks to do well and European importers to likewise outperform.

CAUTION NEEDED IN ASSESSING TOP DIVIDEND PAYERS

NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- A look at the top 15 dividend payers among
America’s largest companies would make any investor salivate --

proposal to cut dividend taxes goes through.
