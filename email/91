NEW YEAR, NEW VOICE
6 WAYS TO GIVE YOUR VOICE A MAKE-OVER=20

Is improving your voice on your list of resolutions for 2003? Here=92s a
checklist of six things to do right now to sound better fast

1.   DO  A  REALITY CHECK
The way we think we sound is not the way we come across to others.
That=92s because the voice we hear inside our head is actually distorted
by the bones of our skull. To get an accurate read on the way others
hear you, record your voice on voice mail, computer, audio tape or video
camera.  Ask 2 or 3 friends to review the recording and give you
balanced feedback. Ask them to tell you about strengths and also areas
for improvement.=20

2.   CHECK YOUR PRONUNCIATION
Mispronounced words can really kill your credibility. Some of the more
common culprits are:=20

Nuclear, (NUKE-lee-ar) not nuke-u-lar
Ask, not axe
Jewelry, (JOOL-ry) not jool-er-y
Enunciate or pronounce, not pronunciate =96 a word that doesn=92t exist
Realtor, (REEL-tor) not real-a-tor
Comparable (COMP-ra-ble), not compare-able..to name just a few
Hear the proper pronunciation of unfamiliar words on line at the
Merriam-Webster website http://www.m-w.com

3.   CHECK YOUR VOCAL HEALTH
If you have throat or voice problems, persistent hoarseness or
laryngitis, see your doctor right away. To help fend off throat=20
infections and  keep the mucosal lining of the respiratory tract moist
and healthy, drink more water, at least 8-10 glasses a day. Mentholated
throat lozenges and certain decongestant nasal sprays and decongestants
can affect the voice by drying out the mucus membranes. Sleep with a
humidifier. Avoid yelling. And by all means, for a better voice and a
longer, healthier life, stop smoking!

4.   WARM UP BEFORE YOU SPEAK
Fine hotels train their employees to think of themselves as going
on-stage whenever they are at work serving the public. So should you.
Your voice is an important part of your stage presence, so take a cue
from actors and singers and warm up your voice at the start of every
business day. Your speech muscles are like any other muscle in the body.
They =91ll work better if given a proper warm up.  One of the simplest
warm ups is humming. Hum a song in the shower or hum along with the
radio on the way to work. Voice Coach subscribers will find  a  vocal
warm up on my website at http://www.greatvoice.com/warmup. It=92s a list
of sentences specially   designed to work every vowel and consonant
sound. Say these sentences slowly out loud at  the start of every day to
help strengthen your voice and sound your best.

5.   CHECK YOUR SPEED
Do you race or ramble when you speak? Speaking too quickly undermines
credibility because it makes you difficult to understand. It=92s also
especially annoying on voice mail. Make a conscious effort to slow down
and pause after every few sentences to allow others to digest what
you=92ve just said. When leaving voice mail, speak especially slowly when
leaving your phone number and don=92t forget to spell your name.=20

6.   CHECK FOR VERBAL VIRUSES
Verbal virus are annoying non-words and mouth noises that can  creep
into our speech such as um, uh, you know, like. Verbal viruses are
unconscious and habitual. Check for them by recording your voice or
listening back to voice mail before sending it. Once you identify your
particular verbal virus train yourself to pause and take a breath before
saying the offending non-word. You can also enlist the help of a friend
and ask them to give you a cue whenever they hear you say the word
you=92re trying to avoid.=20

For a complete voice improvement program, I suggest my VoiceShaping=AE
home study course. See=20

A QUESTION ABOUT EYE CONTACT

VoiceCoach subscriber Eli asks:=20

=93I don't have frontal vision in my left eye and because of this my eyes
do not look focused.  Many times people will not know that I'm looking
at them because my eyes do not seem to focus.  This is no problem with
my students because I tell my class the first day of the situation so
that they will not be uncomfortable.
=20
However, I don't always have opportunity to explain this to people with
whom I deal on short-term basis and am not sure that I should. I'm not
self-conscious or embarrassed about it but know that others are often
uncomfortable because they don't want to possibly embarass me or make an
issue of it.
=20
 I've even thought, seriously, about wearing a patch on my blind eye so
that the lack of focus would not be obvious.  However, I don't want to
hide behind and eye patch if I don't need to do so because I'm
personally okay with the situation.   At the same time, I want to
communicate effectively and don't want to make others feel
uncomfortable. What's your suggestion on how I should handle this?"=20

Susan Berkley responds:
=20
"I think you need to look within and let your intuition tell you how to
deal with each situation on an individual basis. Sometimes you might
choose to explain your eye problem, perhaps in a light manner to make
the person feel at ease, and sometimes you may choose not to. But let=92s
see what the other VoiceCoach subscribers have to say.  If you=92ve got a
suggestion for Eli, send an email to susan@greatvoice.com and I=92ll post
it in next month=92s issue."

Got a question about your voice and communication skills? Send it to
susan@greatvoice.com and I=92ll answer in a future issue of this ezine.

Warmly,=20
Your voice coach

Susan Berkley
