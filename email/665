Greetings All, 

What do you think about burning your own DVDs?
It seems the movie industry doesn't like a the programs
out that allows you to copy your own DVDs.

Number one was "Not Making One" at 18.75%, followed by,
"Lose Weight" at 16.67%, "Get More Organized" at 16.67%,
"Save More Money" at 16.67%, "Exercise More" at 10.42%,
"Stop Smoking" at 6.25%, "Eat Healthier" at 6.25%,
"Drink Less Alcohol" at 6.25% and last was "Spend More 
Time With Family" at 2.08%.  Thanks for voting!

                        BURNING DVDS
DVD x Copy from 321 Studios is a $99.99 program that uses
Windows XP or 2000 computer to make a copy of movies or
other DVDs, BusinessWeek reports.  There is a 
long-recognized "fair use" right under copyright law for
individuals to copy material for their personal use, but
the movie industry thinks the program violates the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.  The Chesterfield, 
Mo.-based company, disagrees. A message stating the disk
is a copy made for personal use only, is the first thing
a viewer sees and if a viewer tries to make a copy of a 
copy, it will fail.  The duplicate also contains a hidden
digital "watermark" that can trace any disk back to the 
specific copy of DVD x Copy used to create it.

                   BRITISH SOLAR POWER
Homeowners across the United Kingdom can apply for a 
government grant to cover 50 percent of the costs of
fitting solar panels to their roofs, The British
Broadcasting Corp. reports.  The $30 million government 
program aims to reduce Britain's carbon emissions, bring
down the cost of solar electricity and dispel the myth 
that solar energy is a non-starter in the U.K. climate. 
Kelly Butler, spokeswoman for the agency administering 
the grants, confirms that even with a 50 percent subsidy 
most systems still cost the homeowner about $10,000.
The same government agency says the average savings on 
electric bills would be roughly up to $138 a year and
that it could take 60 years before the savings justify 
the amount invested.

                COMPETITION FOR SIDEWALKS
Competition for sidewalk space has been an issue since
Medieval times when pedestrians had to dodge garbage flung 
from buildings. Now 33 states have passed legislation 
allowing Segways -- the $4,950 self-balancing motorized
scooter -- on sidewalks.  However, senior citizen and
pedestrian advocacy groups in San Francisco say the
12.5 mile-per-hour pace of a Segway is a threat to public 
safety and it has been banned from sidewalks -- but allowed 
on streets there, The New York Times reports.  Competing
with the Segway for space on urban sidewalks are: vendors,
rollerbladers, strollers, non-motorized scooters, newspaper
boxes, sidewalk cafes, fruit stands, bus shelters and 
benches.
