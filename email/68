Howdy earthlings-

I know everyone is just itching to run off to the gym so
that we can all stick to those New Year's resolutions... but
I was thinking - your fingers need exercise too! So scroll up
and down this email - then practice clicking around on our
site.  Maybe even practice your typing skills by using our
amazing search function.  What a great idea for a workout!

First, I want to mention a really, really great anime series
I just finished watching.  It's called Boogiepop Phantom.
Despite the stupid name, it is a very eerie, creepy show
about the weird happenings in a Japanese town and the bad
things that happen to the high school students.  I really
don't think I can do justice to the show in a few sentences.
It's great, mind-bending, non-linear storytelling and I've
watched it a ton:
