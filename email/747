Feature - Account Aggregation Arrives
******************
By Darryl Nelson 
This year will see significant growth in the number of people using online
account aggregation, that's according to eWise CEO and founder Alex
Grinberg. "This is going to be a significant year for a number of
financial institutions here rolling out aggregation services," he says.
"The market in Australia for internet banking is robust. We would expect
over the next 12-18 months for all the main Australian banks to be
offering account aggregation."

Grinberg's enthusiasm is based largely on the success the company is
having of late in the UK. Egg, eWise's first major international
implementation, went live with its Egg Money Manager service in April.
According to Grinberg, eWise is currently developing services for a number
of other UK institutions, including its first mobile service.

"We've developed and licensed a mobile aggregation service for a UK telco.
It's essentially the same, enabling users to access all their accounts
from their mobile, without the need for keying ID's and passwords," he
explains.

In Australia, the company's application runs Westpac's 'Other Accounts'
service, and it is in the process of working with one other, undisclosed
bank.

Although Grinberg believes the UK is ahead of Australia in terms of
adoption of aggregation services, he argues that Westpac's launch is
helping showcase the system: "Westpac's been going exceptionally well. It
has a smaller user base than Egg, but it's seamless and very well
integrated with its online banking services."

Aggregating success

According to a MORI Poll conducted for Egg in September, 83% (or 5.5
million consumers) of online bankers in the UK want account aggregation.
This is up from 75% in February. "Egg reached more than 100,000 users [of
Egg Money Manger] in under 6 months, and they're growing the user base by
15-20,000 each month," advises Grinberg.

The launch was supported by a TV campaign in the UK and, crucially, the
bank highlights that it guarantees to cover any losses arising from fraud
on any account whilst accessed through the service.

The Poll also identified that the average Egg user aggregates 4 accounts
and views them three times more than previously. Grinberg claims this
3-fold increase in internet banking has flow-on effects for the bank's
main revenue services, helping drive cross-selling and up-selling to
customers.

It is this holistic insight into the full range of financial activities
undertaken by customers that Grinberg argues is the true advantage of
aggregating. "Without aggregation, a bank cannot provide comprehensive
wealth management or financial consultation," he says. "How [aggregation]
is integrated into the bank's core business practices and revenue
generating services is where the real value is."

That value, Grinberg says, is beginning to attract the financial market
place , and he's excited about the company's immediate future. As well as
pushing into the UK market, eWise is targeting Asia, and has a reselling
alliance with NTT Communications in Japan (though no deals have yet been
signed off).

Secure spenders
--
Online account aggregation is not new, but has previously been ignored by
users in droves. Where later systems have learned from past account
aggregation failures is in the area of user security, and eWise's system
enables users to load their own various account ID's and passwords and
store them encrypted locally on their own PC. Every time the user then
logs on to the account aggregation client, it automatically sends the
appropriate details via SSL to the target institution.

As Grinberg explains, this eliminates the need for users to 'key-stroke'
their ID and password details time and again over the internet, making the
possibility of interception more difficult. "The biggest danger comes from
devices that capture key strokes. A system like ours significantly reduces
the risk," he adds.

Of course, whether this is enough to entice Australians to take up account
aggregation remains to be seen. But given the enthusiasm here for online
banking and bill payment - by far the most common activities among regular
internet users - and the growing levels of personal debt (credit card debt
alone stands at a record A$21.9bn, and total personal debt early last year
stood at $70bn, or $3800 for every Australian), it may be an application
whose time has come.
