desire line (di.ZYR lyn) n.

An informal path that pedestrians prefer to take to get from one 
location to another rather than using a sidewalk or other official 
route.

Example Citation
---------------------------------
In areas with no sidewalks, beaten-down paths in the grass, known as 
"desire lines" in planning-speak, indicate yearning, said John La 
Plante, the chief traffic engineer for T. Y. Lin International, an 
engineering firm. "When sidewalks are provided, people do walk," he 
said.
--Patricia Leigh Brown, "Whose Sidewalk Is It, Anyway?," The New York 
Times, January 5, 2003

Backgrounder
---------------------------------
Desire lines (or "natural desire lines," as they're also called) are 
those well-worn ribbons of dirt that you see cutting across a patch 
of grass, often with nearby sidewalks -- particularly those that 
offer a less direct route -- ignored. In winter, desire lines appear 
spontaneously as tramped down paths in the snow. I love that these 
paths are never perfectly straight. Instead, like a river, they 
meander this way and that, as if to prove that desire itself isn't 
linear and (literally, in this case) straightforward.

Earliest Citation
---------------------------------
Study participants also drew charts of pedestrian traffic to take 
note of what are delightfully termed "desire lines"--paths actually 
made by walkers as opposed to those created on the drawing board.
--Thomas Frick, "Rebuilding Central Park," Technology Review, August 
1987

Words About Words
---------------------------------
There is no acceptable term for those elements of language which 
belong to closed groups or are mere fiery spurts of instant poetry 
doomed to die as soon as they are born -- the elements, in fact, 
which waver on the borders of the corpus of the standard language. 
The word "slang" is vague and its etymology obscure. It suggests the 
slinging of odd stones or dollops of mud at the windows of the 
stately home of linguistic decorum.
--Anthony Burgess, British novelist, essayist, and composer, _A 
Mouthful of Air_, 1992
