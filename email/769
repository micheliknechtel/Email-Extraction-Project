CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY SELECTS MARC LINK AND OCLC FOR
 CONVERSION PROJECT

Cambridge University Library has selected MARC Link and OCLC to
perform the retrospective conversion of its guardbook catalogue,
which contains about 1.3 million bibliographic records of books
and periodicals published between 1500 and 1978.  Under terms of
the agreement, MARC Link staff will search the CURL database and
WorldCat, as well as the Research Libraries Group database, in
order to provide an integrated, cost-effective solution for this
important project.  This agreement maximizes the strengths of
each organization to deliver efficiency, convenience and value.
