Picturing Business in America

	http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/journal/index.htm

Unlike many newspapers, the "Wall Street Journal" is loath to print
colorful photos in its pages. However, in 1979, artist Kevin Sprouls
created an illustration technique that uses tiny dots and dashes
to draw a legible portrait that fits into the narrow confines of
the paper's columns. These drawings are called "hedcuts," and this
site explores both the method of their creation and the American
businesspeople they portray. Even though hedcuts aren't signed,
the styles of different artists are distinguishable, particularly
when you compare images of the same subject. As a public figure
changes his or her look, hedcuts must also change. See how home-making
maven Martha Stewart and Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs have
updated their styles and how the "Journal" has kept up. Images of
women pose a unique challenge because their hairdos have to be
cropped to fit the space. Cosmetics queen Mary Kay Ash got cut,
but media guru Oprah Winfrey didn't need a trim. This site offers
a great way to "get inside the heds" of America's business elite.

Navel Maniac

	http://users.swing.be/navels/

Is it possible to create a site that fetishizes a part of the human
anatomy without crossing the line into adult-oriented material?
The answer from Belgium is a hearty "Yes!" Armed with nothing more
than a digital camera and some gumption, the Navel Maniac patrols
the streets of Brussels asking strangers if he can take pictures
of their belly buttons. The resulting site is an ode to innies and
outies alike, as we see a wide variety of very tastefully displayed
navels. Some are pierced, some are pasty, and others are tanned
and taut. This photo-laden devotion to all things bellybutton won't
make your stomach turn. In fact, it will probably prompt you to
ponder more than your own navel.

PBS: GlobalTribe

	http://www.pbs.org/kcet/globaltribe/index.html

Capitalizing on the growing popularity of spirited eco-adventures
with compelling social messages, the new PBS series whisks the
armchair traveler away to exotic locales. Join roving journalist
Amy Eldon as she mucks through the terraced rice paddies of Ifugao
tribespeople and the garbage slums of the Philippines, walks side
by side with Mexico's eco-punks, and witnesses the seeds of change
in a South Africa reborn. Amy seeks to give voice to indigenous
cultures and local visionaries who have limited means to tell their
stories. Her cause is a new kind of tourism: one of volunteerism,
activism, and conscience. In between broadcasts, the site will
provide additional inspiration and resources to help global citizens
take a stand and initiate change. Are you ready to join Amy's
adventure?

Makeup Gallery

	http://www.themakeupgallery.info/

This site gets under the skin of Hollywood and examines how stars
are transformed into wretched creatures, space aliens, or bearded
ladies. "Before" and "after" shots capture the transformation from
actress to character, and with more than 5,000 images from some
600 movies and TV shows, the parade of altered pretty faces is
almost endless. You'll find a chunky Julia Roberts in the fat suits
section, a bevy of animals in the beast in me area, and a couple
of well-known actresses portraying women many years their senior
in the old before their time section. If you're looking for someone
in particular, check the actress index for a list of all the
actresses featured and the movies in which they were "made up."
The site impresses with its level of detail and number of photos,
but we have one question: Where are the real men?

Life Interrupted

	http://www.lifeinterrupted.org/

The Japanese-American internment camps set up during WWII are a
shameful part of our country's history, but this handsome Flash
site aims to focus on the way Japanese-Americans tried to peacefully
carry on with lives that were so abruptly torn apart and transplanted.
Instead of placing blame, it focuses on two little-known camps that
operated in southeastern Arkansas from 1942-44 and the efforts of
local historians and families to preserve artifacts from that era.
Set up to resemble an aging scrapbook, the site features photographs
of detainees in a variety of settings, as well as reference materials
such as area maps, detailed timelines, related articles, and upcoming
memorial events. Of the 120,000 Japanese-Americans relocated from
the West Coast and Hawaii during WWII, 16,000 were interned in
Rohwer and Jerome, Arkansas -- racially segregated hotbeds. Amazingly,
you'll find more smiles than sad stories here. If we are to learn
from our past, we could stand to take a page out of the book of
these brave Americans.

365 Days

	http://www.otisfodder.com/365days.html

The new year finds a determined Otis Fodder tackling an ambitious
project -- posting a new mp3 on his site every day in 2003. The
project focuses on musical pieces, with a concentration on obscure
and out-of-print recordings, and will occasionally feature spoken
word. Included with each recording is a short description of the
piece, the history behind it, and comments from other visitors to
the site. Every Sunday, Fodder will post some "good ol' time
religion." The first Sunday of the year finds Janeen Brady & The
Brite Singers singing a toe-tapping ditty titled "I'm A Mormon."
The site's current selections already include several keepers, such
as Red Shadow's disconcertingly peppy "Understanding Marx" that
features the chorus "...read Marx and Lenin, it will really turn
you loose." Can Otis keep up the brilliance day after day? Like
the aforementioned Janeen Brady & The Brite Singers, we're
believers.

A Photo a Day

	http://www.aphotoaday.org/

A while back, a couple of friends began emailing photos to each
other every day. The circle of recipients slowly grew, and much
like that shampoo commercial from the '70s, friends told friends
who told friends, and a site was born. A perfect example of a "viral
community," this site now boasts over 180 "friends" from around
the world. The three current featured essays focus on photos snapped
on journeys -- one photographer traveled across the country, another
stayed close to home, while the third went around the world and
spent a month in China. The galleries are equally impressive,
featuring works from dozens of members. If you don't get your photo
fix here, head over to the blog where you'll find interesting links
and information. And if you're an aspiring photojournalist, you're
invited to join this "home for work that you shot for you, not
them."
