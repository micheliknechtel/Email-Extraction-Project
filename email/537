No one can uncover a con like the men and women of Sixty Minutes. You might
call CON MEN a collection of their greatest hits, outrageous, fascinating
tales of scams, swindles, and schemes from the nation's leading news
magazine program. From ABSCAM to art forgers, the Reverend R.J. Rudd to
Sante and Kenneth Kimes, this is one rogue's gallery you'll enjoy to no end.

Step aside, Bjork! There's a new Icelandic phenomenon taking the world by
storm. It's author Hallgrimur Helgason, whose 101 REYKJAVIK skewers the
ultramodern thirtysomething hipster life with wicked wit, sharp insight, and
great style. Hlynur Bjorn spends his days on the Web and his nights on the
town, slacking his way through the world...until life starts to catch up to
him. Brutally funny and intensely original, it's an international sensation.
