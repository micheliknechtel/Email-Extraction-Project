HEAVEN SENT GIFT
by Kathleen Ellertson

     Although I'm an animal lover, with two dogs and a kitty of my own, I
never thought I'd be writing with a story until God decided to send me a
four-legged gift for Christmas this year...
     This has been a difficult year for my family.
     My daughter is in a sadly struggling marriage with two young children
and I am the primary caretaker while she is at work.  I'm the shoulder for
her to cry on when she is home.
     It has been bittersweet.  While I have had the privilege of watching
my grandbabies grow up in my arms, it has been difficult because of the
long hours, not to mention my own part-time job.  At times, I've been at
the end of my proverbial rope!
     Christmas Eve, on her way home, my daughter saw something large and
black in the road.  It was too big to drive over without checking to see
what it was, and when she stopped and looked closer, she thought it might
be an animal.  Even with the screech of brakes and bright headlights, it
did not stir until my daughter got out to take a better look.
     Then a soft "thump thump" of a thick tail greeted her.  Laying in the
middle of the road on that cold winter night, thin and without the energy
to take a single step further, lay an old Bassett hound mix -- too cold to
care any longer.
     After getting her into the car and into her house, the old dog seemed
to revive somewhat, but seemed subdued and depressed -- though she was
obviously thankful to be out of the cold!  Unfortunately, my daughter's
dogs hated her on sight, which meant she had to be locked in a bathroom
alone all day and night, with only brief visits outside and into the rest
of the house when the others went out to do their business.
     When I heard of the poor dog's plight, I offered to try her with my
dogs -- I have two of my own -- and while they had never been good with
strange dogs either, I said a brief prayer to St. Francis and asked him to
somehow let my dogs know that we were to help this one.  (If they accepted
her, then I knew my husband would too!)
     An hour later, my daughter arrived and out jumped this wonderful silly
old girl, right into our hearts and into our lives.
     Not only did my dogs NOT growl, but my female (the one I worried most
about) fell in love with this black short-legged beauty almost immediately.
Within minutes they were playing and we finally had to pull them apart
after two hours of rough-housing, so they could rest.  The topper though
was when our 13 year old kitty sashayed in to greet her as though she had
been there all his life!  It was truly amazing.
     Best of all was the effect this new member has had on all of us.
Katie, our female, is prancing around grinning like a puppy again, and our
male has taken on the added responsibility of another household member.
And I have a new shadow that has given me my life back!  Instead of
fretting all day about my daughter's problems (that I cannot fix) I find
myself thinking about Sophie -- petting her silky head, talking to her, and
enjoying being alive again!  Guess we've got ourselves another dog.

             On the fourth day of Christmas
             my true love gave to me...
             A black and tan dog-og-og-ie!

     So add the fact that she arrived on Christmas Eve, and I think that
heaven sent me, and Kate, a four-legged gift this year!

FROM OUR MAILBAG
(in response to Monday's stories, The Gift of Love
and Thankfulness: A Pet Owner's List)

Dear Petwarmers:
     Congrats on the 335th issue.  Keep up the good work!
               -- Misty    <m_easttom @ yahoo.com>

Dear Petwarmers:
     What a wonderful person Beverly Vana is.  There should be more like
her in the world.  Thank you for your concern of all helpless animals.
               -- <Gruttenberg @ aol.com>

Dear Petwarmers:
     How could anyone read this story and not be touched by both the
sadness and the selflessness of the mama cat!  So sorry to hear that none
but Mandible survived that winter.  We live in Michigan and I well remember
that winter.  Thank you.
              -- Troy    <TLEEHALTOM @ aol.com>

Dear Petwarmers:
     Thank you for being the best break in my day.  Petwarmers does so much
for each of us who value the pets in our lives.  You help to educate those
unenlightened who fail to truly appreciate just how valuable a pet is.
Keep up the good work!
               -- Sandy    <SScottjone @ aol.com>

Dear Petwarmers:
     I loved Shelly's Pet Owner's Thankful List.  It was great and so true.
I'm ever so thankful that my Brat cat and Shadow dog are with me.  I love
them dearly and they love me back.  I can't imagine life without them.
              -- <DYSMI @ aol.com>

Dear Petwarmers:
     Shelly's beautiful script touched my heart.  I've written Petwarmers
before about my now 17 year old yellow lab mix.  She doesn't jump or run or
play anymore. She has almost daily accidents in the house (and that's fine
- the carpet will clean).  I know how hard this must be for her.  She was
so very housebroken in her younger days.  Often I have to wake her when I
come home for she doesn't hear me.  Most times I have to help her to her
feet as the arthritis in her back legs bothers her more on some days than
others.  But, behind those cloudy old eyes, I see the remnants of the puppy
I once knew.  I see her eyes still light up when she sees me.  I see the
puppy in her who wants to be.  I'm so indescribably grateful to have had
her in my life for these many years.  And, I will care for her and love her
until that time comes.
           -- Carolyn    <Two121986 @ aol.com>

Dear Petwarmers:
     Today when I read The Gift of Love and a Pet Owners List I cried.
They were both so very touching to me especially now.  On Dec. 22, I lost
my beloved furry child , Skeeter.  She was 13 and a half years old.  She
had the feline form of AIDS.  On her last day I told her it was OK to go to
the Rainbow Bridge and I told her there would be others waiting for her
such as my 17 year old daughter, Brandy, who died in a car accident in
1995, and my parents and Skeeter's sister, Spot.  And they will take care
of her.  She understood and even purred.  That night she tried to hide and
it was so sad to see her try to walk when she couldn't.  She started to
struggle with her breathing and I asked the Lord to not let her suffer.  At
that very moment, she took her last breath.
     It was so very hard for me and for my husband.  We both sat with her
on the living room floor crying.  We both knew it was best for her but we
miss her so much.  I think everyone should have some type of animal because
they teach and give you so much.  The best thing they give is unconditional
love.  So, here I am today, typing this with an empty lap and it's a lonely
feeling.  So, thank you, Petwarmers, for your stories.  They help people
like me to heal and to move on and know there are so many out there just
like me.  And to be thankful for the time that you do have with your furry
children.
               -- Gail      <deltadoc538 @ fuse.net>
