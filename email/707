Although 2003 is already well under way, we're still celebrating at The Old Farmer's Almanac. Here in Dublin, New Hampshire, we're enjoying everything about January -- the snow, the crisp air, and the brilliant blue skies, as well as the new beginnings that this time of year signals. This week, join us to pause and enjoy January.
<p>
Sincerely,
<br>
"The Old Farmer's Almanac"

Ruler of new beginnings, gates and doors, the first hour of the day, the first day of the month, and the first month of the year, the Roman god Janus gave January its name. He was pictured as two-headed (both heads bearded) and situated so that one head looked forward into the new year while the other took a retrospective view. Janus also presided over the temple of peace, where the doors were opened only during wartime. It was a place of safety, where new beginnings and new resolutions could be forged, just as the new year is a time for new objectives and renewed commitments to long-term goals.

<b>Dancing Out the Christmas Tree</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Is your Christmas tree still standing? This year, start a new tradition in your family by taking it out in style, just as people in Sweden do on January 13.
<p>
In Sweden, January 13, St. Knut's Day, is the traditional day to discard the Christmas tree and end the season's festivities. A children's party is the favored way to strip the tree of its decorations, after which the children are free to "plunder" the edible treats and small gifts placed on the tree especially for the occasion. Finally, everyone "dances" the tree out the door. Singing special songs, they pick up the tree and toss it out into the snow. Swedish children look forward to this dancing-out party almost as much as Christmas itself -- and what better way to combat the post-Christmas blues?

<ul>
	<li>Always expect a thaw in January.
	<li>Fog in January brings a wet spring.
	<li>He that drops a coat on a winter day, / Will gladly put it on in May.
	<li>If January calends be summerly gay, / It will be winterly weather till the calends of May.

<b>Breakfast for a Winter Morning</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
There is nothing yummier than a leisurely home-cooked breakfast to start a winter day. This weekend, plan to invite friends over to do just that. Light a fire, put on a pot of coffee, and cook up some <a href="http://www.almanac.com/recipes/search/onerecipe.php?number=58">apple cinnamon pancakes</a>.
<p>
Later, after you've had your fill and the kitchen's cleaned up, get out in the fresh air and take a brisk walk. Months from now, you'll look back and think, <i>What a wonderful break that was!</i>
