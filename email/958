Network Associates Buys Deersoft

SANTA CLARA -- Network Associates said Monday it has bought
Deersoft Inc. as part of a plan to add more anti-spam and
content-filtering technologies to its network-security and
anti-virus products.

Network Associates, which bought McAfee.com in 2002, did not 
disclose the sale's financial terms but said it included 
Deersoft's consumer and enterprise technologies and customer-
support service.

Deersoft, of Palo Alto, Calif., is best known for its SpamAssassin
content-filtering and anti-spam software. The company said it
planned to incorporate Deersoft's technology with McAfee's
SpamKiller Enterprise product for corporate clients immediately and
then to add it to its McAfee Webshield and Groupshield security
products later this year.

"Network Associates' acquisition of Deersoft is the first in a 
series of investments McAfee is making into anti-spam and content 
filtering technology," said Art Matin, president of McAfee for 
Network Associates. "With Deersoft, we have acquired extensions to 
the leading open source 'blacklist' application and we will add 
applications that detect spammers even before they appear on 
blacklists, supplementing that with the ability for customers to 
filter internal content with very tight control."
