   Today!'s Birthday-girl
==========================

Novelist, folklorist, dramatist, and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston 
was born in Eatonville, Florida in 1891. Eatonville was the first 
incorporated black town in the United States, and its dialects, 
customs, and folklore informed Hurston's work for the whole of her 
career. She is best known for her novels, but also collected folklore 
and folk music in Florida, other areas of the South, the Bahamas, and 
beyond. After suffering a stroke in 1959, Hurston was forced to enter a 
welfare home where she died in 1960. She was buried in an unmarked 
grave and her work languished in relative obscurity until 1975, when 
Alice Walker published an article about her. Now her work is 
frequently studied at colleges and universities. (Library of Congress)
