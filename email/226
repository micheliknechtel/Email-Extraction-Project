AuctionWatch Stores Now Listed on Google's New Shopping Search, Froogle!  
AuctionWatch Store customers will now find their store inventory listed on
Froogle (www.froogle.com). Froogle is a new beta service from Google that
makes it easy to find products for sale online. Like the Google search
engine, Froogle quickly provides links to online merchants and storefronts
with products that match a search query.

AuctionWatch is participating in Froogle's beta program by sending Froogle
a daily data feed listing all AuctionWatch stores and items currently
available. Please remember that Froogle is still in BETA testing, so there
may be some occasional delays between posting new items and finding them on
Froogle.

Our Froogle relationship is great news for our Stores customers. All of our
Stores customers now have their Store merchandise listed in the Froogle
directory for FREE. So get ready for more hits to your stores as consumers
begin to use Froogle to search for items to buy. In fact, a few
AuctionWatch sellers have already reported an increase in transactions
through their storefront!

Google has become the most used search engine on the internet, and we are
excited about Froogle's potential as it gains in popularity. So, if you've
been neglecting your AW store lately, be sure to list a few more items and
take advantage of Froogle customers. And don't forget that every
transaction through an AuctionWatch Store is much less expensive than one
on a marketplace.
 ----------------------------------------------------

Check out the New Checkout Button!  Responding to your requests
AuctionWatch has introduced a new checkout tool to help you close sales and
process orders faster! With the AuctionWatch Checkout button, your buyers
now have an easier way to access your checkout pages: they can proceed
directly to your checkout page from the item listing as soon as an auction
closes, without having to wait for a WBN to arrive in the mail. This helps
ensure that your buyers use your preferred checkout method, saving you time
and effort!  
http://www.auctionwatch.com/tutorials/checkout/sample_fromright/generic.html

You can now include the new AuctionWatch Checkout button in any or all of
your listings during the "Create Listing" process. For your eBay and eBay
Motors auctions, the AuctionWatch Checkout button can also be displayed on
a panel that dynamically appears in your listing once the auction closes --
this serves as a further reminder to your winning bidders to use your
preferred checkout method.
http://www.auctionwatch.com//tutorials/checkout/index.html

listing, please click here or, for more information and answers to some
common questions, read our FAQ .
