Dear Women Leaders Online Subscriber,

When anti-choice politicians took full control of Congress last November with the help of the religious right, they declared that restricting and outlawing abortion would be a top priority. Now they are redeeming their promise to the religious right.

It is urgent for the pro-choice majority to speak up and protect our rights. We are therefore working in partnership with NARAL Pro-Choice America to mobilize as many activists as possible.

From: "NARAL Pro-Choice America" <can@naral.org> 
Subject: Tell the Senate to Reject Bush's Judges

President Bush shocked pro-choice Americans on January 7 by re-nominating two demonstrably anti-choice judicial nominees - Charles Pickering and Priscilla Owen. Last year, the Senate Judiciary Committee defeated these two nominees after carefully scrutinizing their records. These re-nominations are a slap in the face to the institution of the Senate. This is yet another attempt by the President to move his anti-choice agenda under the radar of the American public.

Pickering and Owen were rejected specifically because of their hostility to the civil and constitutional rights of women and African-Americans. That President Bush would re-nominate them in the aftermath of the Trent Lott debacle demonstrates the Administration's insensitivity to these issues.

Your Senators must hear immediately that all pro-choice Americans are outraged by these nominations.

While none of the 14 Court of Appeals nominations Bush made yesterday is a friend to choice, six have clear anti-choice records:

Priscilla Owen repeatedly tried to rewrite Texas law from the bench to deny young women their right to choose.

Charles Pickering led the Republican Party to adopt an anti-choice plank to the party platform calling for a Constitutional to ban abortion.

Carolyn Kuhl, working in the Reagan Department of Justice, urged the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.

John Roberts, working in the Reagan and the Bush Departments of Justice, urged the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Timothy M. Tymkovich testified to the U.S. Senate that states should not have to use Medicaid funds to pay for abortions in the case of rape or incest.

Deborah Cook is endorsed by Ohio Right to Life and has argued that a woman may be subjected to child abuse laws for harm done to her fetus.

Please write and call your Senators to let them know how you feel about these nominations. Call the Senate switchboard at 202-224-3121 and ask for each of your two Senators' offices. Tell them that you oppose President Bush's anti-choice, anti-civil rights judicial nominees. Write a personal letter and send it to both of your senators at United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20850.

Tell the Senate to Reject Bush's Judges!
