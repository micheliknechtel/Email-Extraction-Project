Greetings!

This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen. We did our end of
the year inventory and instead of having less inventory we
have MORE! Apparently some of these found items never made
it into our computer. 

This is both good news and bad news... great because we 
found them, but bad because at the end of the month we lose
our extra warehouse space. If we don't get rid of these items,
we'll either be charged a great deal more by our fulfillment
company or this stuff will be moved to my garage! And believe
me, you don't want to have full use of your garage in January
in Chicago!!!!!

This is also GOOD NEWS FOR YOU... Many of the below items we
are selling at or below our cost. But as usual supplies are
limited and are based on a first come first serve basis...
So Hurry!!!!!

Thanks and Be Well,
Anisa 

PS Make sure you look at ALL the items.. there are some
real deals that can easily be missed!
