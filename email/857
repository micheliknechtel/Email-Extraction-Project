  Megawide 17-inch display. It's the first thing you'll notice about
  the world's first notebook computer with a 17-inch display, the
  largest ever in a notebook. When open, it's vast. This PowerBook's
  breathtaking display offers the same viewing area as a 19-inch CRT
  monitor. You'll love the amount of information you can see on the
  screen at one time. It supports a resolution of 1440-by-900 pixels
  - an eye-popping 1.3 million pixels appearing on the screen
  simultaneously, with room aplenty for your menus, toolbars and
  palettes.

  formidable processing power for busgraphic design and editing digital
  video - not to mention playing 3D games, listening to music and
