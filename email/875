Pick up a healthy habit (or two) at http://www.self.com and make 2003 
a banner year for your body and life.

KEEP YOUR SKIN IN THE CLEAR
Piling on the layers is essential when the mercury plunges, but that 
scratchy scarf or buttoned-up coat collar could contribute to 
breakouts on your chin. According to David E. Bank, M.D., a 
dermatologist in Mount Kisko, New York, "The friction of the fabric 
can cause swelling that shuts pores up tight." That's when oils and 
bacteria mix to form pimples. If you're prone to acne, swap your wool 
scarf for softer cotton or cashmere, which is easier on delicate 
facial skin.

DIAL TO DITCH THAT BAD HABIT
Smokers who call quitting help lines are twice as likely to be 
successful as people who try to tackle their addiction solo, say 
researchers at the University of California at San Diego. Ready to 
jettison your cigarettes? For numbers to call, go to 
http://www.cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/quitlines.html. You'll find 
more lifesaving advice in the January issue of SELF. To chat with 
other readers bent on kicking nicotine, go to the "We Quit!" forum at 
www.self.com. And, if you want to get involved in helping others quit, 
go to http://www.americanlegacy.org.

SMART SUPER BOWL SNACKING
There's no need to break your healthy-eating New Year's resolutions on 
Super Bowl Sunday. Whip up a lowfat dip using crabmeat or shrimp 
instead of reaching for the standard high-calorie fare. Try this 
recipe adapted from "Weight Watchers Simply the Best: 250 Prizewinning 
Family Recipes" (Wiley): In a pan, melt 2/3 cup part-skim ricotta 
cheese and 1/4 cup nonfat cream cheese over low heat. Add 1 diced 
tomato, 2 cups peeled, small shrimp (precooked, tails off) or 
crabmeat, 1/3 cup diced onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon 
garlic salt. Cook 4 to 5 minutes. Serve with toasted slices of 
whole-wheat bread or crudite instead of crackers.
