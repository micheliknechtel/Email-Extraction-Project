The Flaming Lips Battle The Rhapsody Users!

The Flaming Lips are a popular band around RHAPSODY headquarters. Not only did our staff vote their most recent album, Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots, the best record of 2002, but now the Lips themselves have bestowed upon us a wealth of non-album material to share with RHAPSODY subscribers. 

Take a listen as the band talk you through Yoshimi, track by track. In addition, you can hear the album outtake "Up Above The Daily Hum" alongside the group's typically twisted take on "White Christmas" (yes, we know that Christmas has passed -- but we just want to share the love). 

We've also put together a playlist that features all of these tracks and a selection of some of our favorite Flaming Lips tunes. Get a primer on why the Flaming Lips have become one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the new millennium -- only on RHAPSODY!

Non-subscribers, it's easy to join RHAPSODY and begin listening right now. Just launch the playlist below and click any of the orange "Subscribe Now" buttons anywhere in the service. Don't have RHAPSODY yet?
