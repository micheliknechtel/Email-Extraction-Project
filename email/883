Protect Your Privacy and Boost System Performance with Window Washer

It's proven that unwanted files like cookies, cache and history, while not
harmful to your system, can overload your hard drive, quickly creating
hundreds of megabytes of unnecessary clutter. These files significantly
burden system resources, and worse, can enable others to track your online
activity, exposing you to the risk of privacy invasions. Window Washer
easily and safely wipes away all traces of your PC and Internet activity to
improve system performance and protect your privacy. See for yourself how
much drive space Window Washer can recover on your system.

** Thousands Stayed Home and Partied Online in Virtual New Years Parties

While many Americans may have stayed home this New Years eve that
didn't stop them from participating in virtual parties. Sims Online
hosted over 5000 events for its hottest new game, Sims Online.
Launched this past December, owners of this wildly popular game took
advantage of having their own SIMS character meet with other SIM
characters as they socialized and celebrated with neighbors,
acquaintances, roommates, friends and loved ones.

In Sims Online, players create and control the actions of a
character known as a Sim. Players enter the world with a small
amount of money to spend as they wish. They can purchase their own
piece of land to do with as they please, or they can join with other
players to create shared homes and businesses or host wild events.

Players can explore the neighborhoods around them and meet scores of
other Sims along the way. Players get to know other Sims through
live text chat and secret instant messages. As players type, their
messages appear in speech bubbles above their Sims' heads. Sims can
also express themselves through hundreds of animations. A polka,
pile drive, or a passionate kiss, are just a few of the gestures
available for Sims to use to convey exactly what's on their mind.

Sims Online is available for $50.00 at major retailers and includes
a six months membership to the service. Monthly subscriptions are
$10.00 per month and do not require the "The Sims" $50.00 retail
game as a pre-requisite. For more info, visit:
http://www.thesimsonline.com.


** Belkin Announces 3 New Peripherals for the Mobile PC Traveler

Belkin Corporation has announced three new devices for the mobile
professional worth sharing with our readers here. All will be
shipping by Jan 7, 2003 in North America.

The International Notebook Travel Surge Protector ($29.99) protects
your valuable notebook computers and modems from harmful surges and
spikes while in any country throughout the world. Featuring an
ultra-compact in-line design, it offers complete automatic multi-
voltage TEL-computing protection, includes a convenient 8'
retractable phone cord, over-current detection and power indicators,
238 Joules of protection, and a $75,000 Connected Equipment
Warranty. (Now that would be a costly power surge.)

The Universal AC Travel Adapter (ESP $19.99) comes with patented integrated
plugs that work with all different types of outlets, the world over. Users
can now charge their laptop, PDA, and cell phone in places as diverse as
Europe, Asia, North America, Australia, New Zealand, China, and the UK.
Rated to handle both 110- and 220-240-volt standards, the Belkin Universal
Travel Adapter allows users to connect to international power outlets
without a complicated power conversion and eliminates the hassle of carrying
multiple adapters to give the user a unified, convenient power solution.

Finally, the Universal Serial Bus (USB) Numeric Keypad (ESP $19.99),
is a compact keypad for the mobile professional. Featuring a
lightweight, ergonomic design, the Keypad works instantly with USB
Plug-and-Play technology, offers an ergonomic, 19-key layout,
features a slim, lightweight design, works seamlessly with USB-ready
notebook computers, and is ideal for travel.

** Product Repairs Scratched DVD,Game, and CDR Disks

Tired of tossing away expensive damaged disks and shelling out lots
of bucks for new ones? A hardware product called "Skipdoctor" claims
to repair and bring damaged disks back to life. It's available in
many major retail stores and video stores including Best Buys,
Wall*mart, Blockbuster, We've heard of using toothpaste to "erase"
scratches but this may be a better alternative. If you've used this
product let us know how it worked for you at:csi@wugnet.com.

** Netscape to Block Popup Ads

AOL's Netscape subsidiary has announced that the next release of its
browser, Netscape 7.01, will include pop-up blocking support.
Previously, AOL announced that the AOL 8.0 client would block popups
from non-AOL Time Warner companies.

These initiatives from major ISPs and now, browser software
publishers, are signaling a new trend. Earthlink also started to
troll for new members for its dialup and DSL service in late summer
using Pop-Up blocking software as an incentive. Major web
destination site, iVilliage, has also announced that it was banning
popup advertisements on its website and affiliates.

What impact will this have on the other major website portals like
ESPN, ABCNews, Yahoo, and major cable modem providers: ATT Comcast,
Charter Communications and Cox? And how will Microsoft respond to
Netscape's inclusion of popup blocking support with its next release
of Internet Explorer? Will MSN announce an upgrade to its MSN 8.0
client that offers popup blocking support? Stay tuned.

** Real Networks Acknowledges Security Flaws RealOne Player

Multimedia Software developer, Real Networks, has announced a
software patch for its currently released RealOne Player that
addresses acknowledged security flaws. The patch supposedly updates
the RealOne client by eliminating 9 previously documented security
holes in the RealPlayer client that give attackers the ability to
take over an end-user's PC.

Several outside security consultants have questioned Real Network's
efforts in declaring its software free of security holes after
patches are released. Current users of RealOne are advised to update
their player by selecting "Check for Updates" menu option, which
will automatically take them to the Real Network download site for
the patch.

** AOL Succeeds in Suit Against Adult Spammers

Congratulations should go to AOL's lawyers for successfully suing a
"spam ring" and winning a judgment of $7 million.  The spam network
sllegedly served up over 1 billion spam to AOL's users. The latest
suit initiated by AOL against identified spamming firms is just one
of 20 active suits that the company is pursuing.

If successful, legal efforts against spammers by the world's largest
ISP, along with newly enacted state legislation outlawing spamming
cannot halt the flood, what will? The next step is likely to be
increasing pressure on the Bush administration and Congress from
corporations, trade associations, ISPs, and consumers to enact
federal anti-spam legislation.

** Symantec Anti-Virus Products Included in Recent Spam Content

Unfortunately, we seem to be on the receiving end of a lot of "spam"
offering Symantec's Anti-Virus products. Almost all the spam offers
came from unrecognized senders despite reassuring text accompanying
the emails stating that the offers are being sent because the
recipient consciously opted in to receive such offers. However we
can't remember ever opting in to any of these programs.  Although
its more likley that once you opt-in to one program your name is
being sent to another unrecognized third party who is part of their
network or maybe not. We've run into situations where the
unsubscribe links won't necessarily get you off the entire optin
network or lead to dead ends.  By the way if you want to opt out of
the two major opt-in networks from one location. Check out his link.
http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp

We don't know if Symantec, a publicly held corporation, is aware of
these offers, but it does affect the marketing and business
practices and it could even damage their position with customers and
hurt other well respected, PC software, and hardware vendors.
Customer loyalty and trust is vital to encourage long term
relationships with customers. Once you lose their trust it's hard to
get it back.

Symantec, one of the leaders of privacy, anti-virus, Windows
utilities and security software, should take a look at this problem
and check to see if any of these emails are coming from authorized
resellers. If they are, maybe Symantec can implement a policy to
prevent its products from being part of these offerings.


** A Search Engine That Supports Word Documents on the Web

Finally, a competitor to Google that does something truly unique and
valuable that Google does not do--allow you to search the web for
information stored specifically in Word documents stored on the web.
Fast, developers of the "FAST Search Engine" has announced that
their search engine website AlltheWeb.com is now indexing documents,
stored in Microsoft Word format, and are included in its web search
results. A new feature in AlltheWeb.com's advanced search page
allows us to selectively search only MS Word documents.
http://www.alltheweb.com/advanced/

Fast's search engine is used by both search portals Lycos and
Hotbot.com, who have also announced the inclusion of the Word search
feature on their sites.

** Office Evolves Thanks to New MS Office Tools

Microsoft has announced a new set of developers tools called "Visual
Studio Tools for Office". The new tools will allow third parties to
create applications using C## and Visual Basic .NET and take
advantage of the upcoming release of Office 11 and XML supported
documents. Microsoft's VP of Developer Platform and Evangelism
Division said, "the new tools enable developers to build solutions
that provide an intuitive end-user experience. With .NET-connected
software and the power of Office, developers can create a broad
range of applications that span from devices, to datacenter servers,
and now to Office."

The current VBA platform in Office will still be supported, but will
not allow developers to take advantage of newly added security and
deployment of .NET and Office 11. One developer pointed out that the
new set of tools will allow a programmer to finally incorporate a
"no touch deployment" option in their applications that gives a
developer the ability to upgrade and modify finished applications
without end-user interaction. Speculation is that the set of tools
will be released as beta to current Visual Studio .NET developers
and MSDN subscribers.
