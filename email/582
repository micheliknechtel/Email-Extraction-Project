YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

Q. I KNOW THE CPI REFLECTS INFLATION, BUT WHAT IS IT, AND HOW
DOES IT WORK?

A. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S.
Consumer Price Index "is a measure of the average change over
time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket
of consumer goods and services." The "basket" includes items
such as cereal, fuel oil, pet food, rent, postage, cigarettes,
college tuition, prescription drugs, and haircuts. The index
shows that if you bought these goods and services for $100 in
1975, they'd cost $331 in 2001.

The BLS adds: "The CPI market basket is developed from detailed
expenditure information provided by families and individuals on
what they actually bought. ... Altogether, more than 30,000
individuals and families provided expenditure information for
use in determining the importance, or weight, of the over 2000
categories in the CPI index structure."

The index is used as an economic indicator and a means of
adjusting dollar values, among other things. You'll find all you
ever wanted to know about it on the BLS website.

Q. WHERE CAN I TURN IF I NEED PROFESSIONAL HELP GETTING OUT OF
DEBT?

A. If you've exhausted all other options, consider using a
nonprofit credit counseling organization, ideally one that's a
member of the National Foundation for Consumer Credit (NFCC). To
get the name and number of an office near you, click over to the
NFCC. The website offers additional helpful information and some
online counseling, as well.

Understand, though, that signing up with professional credit
counseling agencies can result in a black mark on your credit
report for several years. So do try to use another option first.

If you or someone you care about is resolved to get out of debt
this year, visit our Resolution Solutions area for practical
tips on how to get it done.

THIS WEEK'S LESSON

IRA MYTHS
IRAs have been around since 1974, but they're often
misunderstood. To avoid needless headaches and maximize your
money, separate IRA myths from truths.

- MYTH: A minor may not open an IRA.

  TRUTH:All that's required to open a traditional or Roth IRA is
  taxable compensation. Whether you're 15 or 75, if you've earned
  income, you can contribute to an IRA.

- MYTH: A stay-at-home spouse is ineligible for an IRA.

  TRUTH: As long as the couple files a joint tax return, an IRA
  contribution for the stay-at-home spouse is allowed based on
  the working spouse's taxable compensation.

- MYTH: You must make your contribution to an IRA by Dec. 31.

  TRUTH: The IRS allows it to be made as late as the regular date
  you must file your income tax return for that year. You have
  until April 15, 2002 to make an IRA contribution for 2001.

- MYTH: If you take money from your traditional IRA before age 59
  1/2, you must pay an early withdrawal penalty. Truth: There are
  several exceptions that permit penalty-free withdrawals before
  age 59 1/2.

- MYTH: On reaching age 70 1/2, a minimum required distribution
  (MRD) must be taken annually from each traditional IRA you own.

  TRUTH:An MRD must be computed for each traditional IRA owned by
  someone who is age 70 1/2 or older, but the MRD for each of
  those multiple IRAs may be totaled, and that total may then be
  taken from any one or more of the IRAs. (And MRDs are just
  minimums. You can always withdraw more.)

- MYTH: If you recently rolled over an IRA to a new broker, you
  can't move that money again for at least a year, or you'll be
  taxed and penalized.

  TRUTH:That's true only if you're receiving the money in the
  form of a check. You may instead arrange for a direct transfer
  from one IRA custodian to another as often as you want without
  running afoul of the once-a-year rollover rule.

There's more to learn about IRAs at our Retirement Center and
the IRS website. Also useful is our Tax Center and book, The
Motley Fool Tax Guide.
