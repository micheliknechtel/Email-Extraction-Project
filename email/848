The Padawan Post -- The official e-newsletter of StarWarsKids.com
Tuesday, January 14, 2003 Issue # 51


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Honoring Young Fans of the Star Wars Saga 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this first issue of the Padawan Post for 2003, StarWarsKids.com 
honors our online Padawans -- the voice of young fans of the 
Star Wars saga. Over the last few years, but especially in 2002, 
thousands of you have expressed your love of Star Wars, your 
opinions about Star Wars, your everything about Star Wars on our 
three unique "message boards" -- the Padawan Viewscreen, the Saga 
Talk Viewscreen, and the Books & Toys Viewscreen. By doing so, 
you've met kids like yourself and shown that the young fans of 
today are just as passionate about Star Wars as the young fans 
of the 1970's and '80's. The only difference between now and then 
is that you are part of the Star Wars generation that gets to talk 
about it online with other young fans from around the world!

To start off the new year, click the link below to see the on-going 
list of Padawans who have earned the Padawan of the Week award. Then, 
visit the links below to read and respond to some Star Wars classic 
and prequel issues submitted by your fellow Padawans.

Did Mace Windu Really Need To...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Padawan Viewscreen is a casual hang-out for Padawans to meet and 
share their Star Wars opinions. Below are two Topic of the Week issues 
for you to respond to. Padawan Hoth_Mayor submitted: Did Mace Windu 
really need to lead all those Jedi into the Geonosis Arena?
Padawan Boba's Buddy wants to know: In Episode I, 14-year-old Queen 
Amidala proved that young people could successfully handle major 
responsibilities. I know I couldn't be a young ruler like Amidala - 
I can barely remember to feed my dog! But I'm curious if any of you 
think you could be a teenage ruler. Why or why not?

Do You Think That The Republic And The Jedi...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Saga Talk Viewscreen is the hub of debate about the films of the 
Star Wars saga. The opinions expressed here are often strong and backed 
with detail. Padawan Jaina Solo submitted this question for the Saga
Talk Viewscreen Topic of the Week: Considering that Anakin was the
instrument of destruction for both the Republic and the Empire, do
you think that the Republic and the Jedi would have been able to stop
the Emperor if there hadn't been a Luke or Anakin Skywalker? Please
explain. And Padawan E-Vader posted: Did Han ever lose his cool? 
If so, when?

What Was The First Star Wars Toy...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Padawans have written so much about their favorite Star Wars books and 
toys on the Books & Toys Viewscreen, but we've never asked you to tell 
us about the first Star Wars toy you ever got. Now's your chance. What 
was it? How did it make you feel? How many toys do you have now?
