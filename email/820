<br>The Trail
<br>
<br>
<br>"Therefore strengthen the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, and
make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated,
but rather be healed.  Pursue peace with all people, and holiness.."  - Hebrews
12:12-14.
<br>
<br>Michael Brown was arrested after breaking into a bank after hours in a small
community in Arkansas.  All of the bank's money was in the vault and unreachable
so Brown took what was available - candy.  As Brown left the bank he began to
eat the candy (Dum-Dums) unwrapping each piece and throwing the wrapper on the
ground as he walked to his home.  Police officers spotted the trail of wrappers
and followed it to Brown's home at a mobile home park where he was arrested.
<br>
<br>Michael Brown vividly illustrates that we each through the lives we live
leave a trail.  It may not be as visible as the one Michael left but it is still
a trail.  Some like Michael leave trails, which are not straight, and if
followed will not bring healing but further pain.  Others leave trails that if
followed will bring healing and strength to the weak and weary.  The writer of
Hebrews calls these trails "straight paths."
<br>
<br>If we would travel the "straight paths" and lead others along those paths we
must avoid the crooked paths.  Anger is one of those crooked paths.  We are told
in Hebrews to "pursue peace with all people, and holiness" and we are warned
"lest any root of bitterness springing up cause trouble."  Are there roots of
bitterness marking your path? Or, is your path one marked by peace?
<br>
<br>Today, where are your feet headed?  Are they on the straight path lifting up
the weak hands, giving strength to the weak knees, bringing peace to the
troubled, healing to the lame?  What path, which path are you traveling today?
What kind of trail are you leaving?
