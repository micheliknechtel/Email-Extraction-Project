Dear Cooking and Wine Subscriber:
 
Fat that's GOOD for you? Full meals for every weeknight that SAVE you time?
Satisfying meals that help you LOSE weight? All true. How? Here are our
secrets:
 
*   *   *
No time to shop?  No energy to cook?  No stomach for more takeout?  No
problem! THE ACCIDENTAL GOURMET has you covered. Suzannah Sloan and Sally
Sondheim (a gourmet and a "get-me-out-of-the-kitchen) have teamed up to plan
meals for a full year of weeknights--easy to prepare, easier to shop for,
and delicious to eat.  A must for every busy family.

Forget everything you think you know about fat. The good fats are vital for
good health, and by indulging in favorites like chocolate, coconut, olive
oil, butter, avocado, and fish, you're feeding your brain, heart, memory,
and more. Now in THE GOOD FAT COOKBOOK, Fran McCullough (author of the
bestselling LOW-CARB COOKBOOK) gets past the myths and finds the flavor in
the fat phenomenon, with over a hundred recipes to put the good fats back in
your food.
