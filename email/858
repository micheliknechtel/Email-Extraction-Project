THIS WEEK'S OUTLOOKPOWER TIP
-------------------------------------------------------------------

<font color="#800000" face="VERDANA,HELVETICA,Arial">Happy New Year everyone! We're kicking off the new year with a tip that'll help
stop the plague that's been cursing all of us: spam. Read Diane's great tip to learn
how you can modify your Exchange Server to help you slam spam. By the way, if you're
not the Exchange administrator, feel free to pass this email along to him or her. It'll
be a big help to your whole team.</font>

<b>USING EXCHANGE SERVER TO BLOCK SPAM</b>
By Diane Poremsky, Contributing Editor

Before we begin this week's tip, I recently mentioned the new holiday file
Microsoft released, which included holidays for 2003-2007. It's been reported
that there are at least two errors in the file, one for Hanukah and Independence
Day. How many can you find? Write to me at outlook@cdolive.com, if you are using
the new holiday file and find these or additional errors.

This week's tip is for Exchange Server administrators. If you aren't an admin
but still get too much spam on your Exchange account, you might want to forward
this tip to your administrator.

Exchange Server includes just one spam fighting feature: Filter. It's not as
good as a content filter, since it only filters on the sender's addresses and
only stops spam from known spammer domains, but for those companies without a
content filter, it can reduce the amount of spam the users receive and costs
nothing to implement.

In Exchange 2000, Filter is located in Global properties, right click on Message
Delivery. In Exchange 5.5, it's at Connections | Internet Mail Service
properties | Connections tab. Both versions allow you to archive messages, but
archiving requires a lot of disk space if you get a lot of spam.

Both servers have the option to filter blank senders, this is not recommended,
since read receipts often have blank sender fields. You can filter without
notifying the sender that you are filtering, which is recommended to reduce
server load. Some of the spammer domains use NDRs (Non-Delivery Receipts) to
remove names from their mailing lists, others may decide NDRs indicate filtering
on their domain name so they switch to a new domain. In one test I did,
approximately one-third of all NDRs were returned as undeliverable, which
generated more traffic on my server.

Filtering works by comparing the senders email address to your list of domains
you don't want mail from.. The filter accepts several different formats,
including the full email address, cpo@edirect.com or @mailbox.com. It accepts
wild cards, so you can filter on partial addresses, like deal@* and
@*superdeal*. Exchange seems to have a limit of about 1500 items in the list,
so the ability to use wild cards is important and done properly, can greatly
reduce the amount of spam you get, without blocking mail you want.

You can use two wild cards, for example @*dailydeal* works, but three wildcards
as in @*dailydeal*.* won't work. When you add @*dailydeal* to the filter, it
will filter all mail from any domain containing dailydeal in the domain name,
including @mydailydeal.com, @opt4546.mydailydeal.net, @dailydeal.spammer.com,
etc. Wildcards are a good way to filter out casino, gamble and gambling domains,
and I'm tempted to add filters for @*deal*, @*daily* and @*optin*, but I worry
that a legitimate domain might use one of those words in their name.

This method isn't an end all for spam. The first limitation is that it only
works with the From address or domain, the second limitation is that it only
handles approx 1500 entries. Finally, since it's domain based, it isn't useful
for stopping spammers who fake the From address to appear from AOL, Hotmail, or
Yahoo unless you block all mail from those domains. It's much better to use a
content filter, such as GFI's MailEssentials or NEMX and filter by both domain
and content, but until you can implement a real content filter, Exchange's
domain filter will eliminate some of the spam your users receive.</pre>
