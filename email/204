>=20
> Hello Aliza,
>=20
> This will come as a surprise to you, but not too many quilts were made in
> the colonial days. When they were, they were not made of blocks, but were
> all wool, one piece (two pieces were seamed together really because of the
> narrow width of a loom woven piece in those days.). They were called
> Wholecloth quilts. The British and European countries made block quilts
> occasionally. They would use one shape over and over again like triangles=20=
or
> hexagons.  They also liked a tiny square in a square block repeated. But
> most women made wholecloth quilts, from wools, or chintz if they were
> affluent and could afford it.
>=20
> Block style quilts became popular here around 1840.  There are not stories
> behind most block names, and most block patterns have many many different
> names. This tells us that a woman named a block on what she was told it wa=
s
> called, or she made-up a name based on the times, where she lived and what
> was important to her at that time. Women made social comments through thei=
r
> needlework, and quilts were no exception.
>=20
> There are some blocks, like the goblet block that was made by women in fav=
or
> of temperance. It was popular in the later 19th century, but we still thin=
k
> of The Movement when we see it made later, but it didn't necessarily signi=
fy
> this to the maker. The Whig Rose pattern was made in dedication to the Whi=
g
> political party in the mid 19th century, but was still being made long aft=
er

a
> political stance.
>=20
> In my opinion, there isn't a book per se that is definitive on this as the=
re

>=20
> Fabric Choices
>=20
> Many of us love quilting, but usually voice our opinion loudly to all=20
> quilters and shop owners about how hard it is to pick out the colors for a=
=20
> quilt.  Personally, I would rather pick out 20 fabrics for a quilt than to=
=20
> pick out only 3 choices - more is better in my book.  How do you start to=20
> pick out the perfect fabrics for your quilt?  First you need a starter=20
> fabric, the fabric you just saw, fell in love with and have to take home.=20=
=20
> This fabric should be a multi colored fabric with your favorite colors in=20=
a=20
> medium to large-scale print. =20
>=20
> For example you have picked a beautiful Hoffman batik with olive green,=20
> blue, some brown and little gold flecks.  I will then drape this=20
> scrumptious fabric somewhere in the shop (with the owners permission) and=20
> then add a dark, medium and light value of the main color, olive green.  I=
=20
> will then add a dark, medium and a medium light value of the blue.  The=20
> gold will be my accent color and the brown could be my background color in=
=20
> a light value.  Now use the most important tool you own and that would be=20
> your feet - Walk Away from the pile of fabric at least 10 feet and then=20
> turn around, and squint. This simple exercise will reveal which colors pop=
=20
> out or are too similar.  Squinting takes out some of the color and lets yo=
u=20
> see the value of the fabrics and how they work together.  If one of the=20
> colors is screaming to get out of the pile then pull it out.  =20
>=20
> Also remember it is important to blend your colors and NOT to match them=20
> perfectly with your starter fabric.  Walking away from your fabric and the=
n=20
> looking at the colors will give you a good idea if your quilt is going to=20
> sing or if it is a dull quilt.=20
> Keep adding and subtracting to your pile until you have the required numbe=
r=20
> of fabrics you need. This is when I suggest you walk away again and go loo=
k=20
> at a book, pattern or just talk to another quilter in the store for a=20
> minute.  Then return back to your colors and make any final adjustments to=
=20
> your colors.  Walking away and focusing on something else gives your eye a=
=20
> fresh look at the selection.  =20
> One other rule to consider is to be sure you love your fabrics, if you lov=
e=20

=20

=20

>=20
> Many times the multicolored fabric that I had to have does not make it on=20

=20

<BR>SHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, A SECRET........
<BR>Coming very soon (you will get the link in the next NPN) is our Second A=
nnual Mystery Quilt by Billie Lauder! &nbsp;Billie has graciously agreed to=20=
share another mystery with us. &nbsp;So many of us enjoyed her Faux Log Cabi=
n last January and yes, some of us even finished ours. &nbsp;Soooooo, get re=
ady for the list of fabric requirements in our next NPN and then we will be=20=
off once more, creating another beautiful quilt.

<BR>2003 BOMs
<BR>After many invitations to designers we have decided to try something new=
 this year. &nbsp;We will have some short term BOMs but will not have a 12 m=
onth BOM. &nbsp;What we *will* have is a POM (Project of the Month)!
<BR>
<BR>We are blessed with many good things........family, friends, health (for=
 some of us), fabric, time to sew (LOL). &nbsp;Unfortunately others are not=20=
as blessed as we. &nbsp;This year we propose to help others, in some small w=
ay. &nbsp;Each month (beginning in February) we will share a block pattern A=
ND a charity with the suggestion that you use that block pattern and dig int=
o your stash and create a quilt (or whatever the suggested project might be)=
 and donate it to the charity of the month. &nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>We know that many of our quilters already support numerous charities. &n=
bsp;But if even a portion of our NPN readers made up a quilt/project each mo=
nth, think of how many deserving people would be happier?
<BR>
<BR>We will create a webpage and share the link with everyone in our NPN eac=
h month. &nbsp;There will be a gallery on the webpage so everyone can share=20=
pictures of quilts/projects that they have created this year.
<BR>
<BR>Charities we have in mind: &nbsp;ABC Quilts, Newborns in Need, Linus Pro=
ject, Cancer Society, Ronald McDonald Houses, Hospice, and Nursing Homes. &n=
bsp;If anyone has further suggestions, please send them on to me. &nbsp;We r=
ealize we cannot cover all the charities in one year but we would like to ha=
ve one different one each month.
<BR>
<BR>In July, we will stop for the month and have a project just for us! &nbs=
p;Stay tuned for more information on that.

<BR>NEW PATHWAYS into QUILT HISTORY: by Kimberly Wulfert, Ph.D.
<BR>
<BR>Happy New Year to Everyone and our wonderful NPN staff! Hopefully your h=
olidays provided a little break from routine and a chance to share some qual=
ity quilting time with your friends. Maybe you received a quilt history book=
 or two as a gift. Maybe you found that terrific deal on an auction site and=
 got your first antique or vintage quilt, top or blocks. Finding antiques is=
 half the fun, owning that special one that speaks to you is the other. Smar=
t shoppers learn all about what their heart throbs for BEFORE they go shoppi=
ng. Digging for treasure AND finding it is hard when you don't know a treasu=
re when you see it. Books, classes, websites, antique quilt exhibits and mus=
eums, and study groups are all good paths for learning. On-line auctions sit=
es are fun, but the information is NOT always correct, nor are the tags on q=
uilts for sale in shops. Start by picking one style of quilt or an era that=20=
you like, and learn about that first. You will find yourself branching off f=
rom there.
<BR>
<BR>First up are the answers to last issue's word scramble game. Yes, I did=20=
spell #10 incorrectly by leaving out a letter. I was just testing you...yeah=
 right :-) Thanks to each of you who wrote me. The feedback was positive and=
 I'll do another one in the future.
<BR>
<BR>1) furze - ruffle -Occasionally seen on early quilts, more often on craz=
y quilts and on 1930s and 40s quilts)
<BR>2) fenki - knife -The top and back seam allowances are turned inside and=
 the seam is stitched closed. Sometimes a top stitch is used or added. This=20=
edge results when the top and bottom are sewn together and turned inside out=
.
<BR>3) vwneo pate - woven tape - Found mainly on early quilts. Trenton tape=20=
was a common, made in the New Jersey city of the same name. It could be a so=
lid or a stripe woven tape made for binding purposes)
<BR>4) nifger - fringe - Seen on Whitework (all white) quilts pre 1850. Thes=
e were made for special occasions. Occasionally seen on other early quilts,=20=
and later silk block styles and crazy quilts
<BR>5) ppqlaieu evni - applique vine - often found on red and green applique=
 quilts made between 1840 and 1880
<BR>6) tootwash - sawtooth - Could be pieced or appliqued and has been seen=20=
on quilts through time
<BR>7) gwass &amp;sowb - swags &amp;bows - Appliqued border seen on 19th cen=
tury quilts
<BR>8) dolis - solid - wide borders on early quilts were a single piece of c=
hintz or toile. They became more narrow as time went on.
<BR>9) leptumil odrrbse - multiple borders - common in the 20th and 21st cen=
turies
<BR>10) arrepi nptsio - correct version is arrepii nptsio - prairie points -=
 most often used on 1920-1940 quilts
<BR>11) cplasolde - scalloped - common border for applique quilts in 1915-19=
50 quilts
<BR>12) saib teap - bias tape - 20th century store bought tape made on the b=
ias for using on curves
<BR>
<BR>Next we have a reader's letter with a common question I receive from par=
ents and teachers.
<BR>
<BR>"I am a fifth grade teacher and am teaching Colonial America. &nbsp;I am=
 not a
<BR>quilter, but I would like to incorporate a quilting project with parent
<BR>help, into the curriculum. &nbsp;I am looking for three or four patterns=
 of quilt
<BR>squares that were common in Colonial times. I am also looking to find ou=
t
<BR>the significance and/or meaning of the patterns, as I understand most
<BR>squares incorporated some type of meaning. Can you recommend a web site=20=
that shows
<BR>this? &nbsp;I haven't been able to come up with one, but your site seeme=
d very
<BR>comprehensive, so I thought I would ask. &nbsp;Thank you for any help yo=
u can
<BR>offer."
<BR>
<BR>Sincerely,
<BR>Aliza in Pennsylvania, December 12, 2002
<BR>
<BR>Hello Aliza,
<BR>
<BR>This will come as a surprise to you, but not too many quilts were made i=
n
<BR>the colonial days. When they were, they were not made of blocks, but wer=
e
<BR>all wool, one piece (two pieces were seamed together really because of t=
he
<BR>narrow width of a loom woven piece in those days.). They were called
<BR>Wholecloth quilts. The British and European countries made block quilts
<BR>occasionally. They would use one shape over and over again like triangle=
s or
<BR>hexagons. &nbsp;They also liked a tiny square in a square block repeated=
. But
<BR>most women made wholecloth quilts, from wools, or chintz if they were
<BR>affluent and could afford it.
<BR>
<BR>Block style quilts became popular here around 1840. &nbsp;There are not=20=
stories
<BR>behind most block names, and most block patterns have many many differen=
t
<BR>names. This tells us that a woman named a block on what she was told it=20=
was
<BR>called, or she made-up a name based on the times, where she lived and wh=
at
<BR>was important to her at that time. Women made social comments through th=
eir
<BR>needlework, and quilts were no exception.
<BR>
<BR>There are some blocks, like the goblet block that was made by women in f=
avor
<BR>of temperance. It was popular in the later 19th century, but we still th=
ink
<BR>of The Movement when we see it made later, but it didn't necessarily sig=
nify
<BR>this to the maker. The Whig Rose pattern was made in dedication to the W=
hig
<BR>political party in the mid 19th century, but was still being made long a=
fter
<BR>they were gone, doubtless because of it's beauty, not it's affiliation t=
o a
<BR>political stance.
<BR>
<BR>In my opinion, there isn't a book per se that is definitive on this as t=
here
<BR>isn't anything definitive to say about pattern names. &nbsp;There are au=
thors who
<BR>list patterns and their starts, but each book will tell you something
<BR>different about the same pattern, which brings us full circle to the sta=
rt
<BR>of this email. Author and quilt historian, Barbara Brackman has written=20=
the
<BR>
<BR>"Encyclopedia of Pieced Blocks Patterns", <A HREF=3D"http://www.amazon.c=
om/exec/obidos/ASIN/0891458158/antiquequilta-20/102-1390650-7732121">http://=

<BR>with thousands of patterns, and
<BR>the different names they have been given that she can verify. So most ar=
e
<BR>dated to the 20th century, and some to the 19th century. &nbsp;She also=20=
wrote an
<BR>"Encyclopedia of Appliqu=E9." <A HREF=3D"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obid=

om/exec/obidos/ASIN/0939009757/antiquequilta-20/102-1390650-7732121</A> Both=
 of these are reference books with the most
<BR>comprehensive list of block patterns and their names available today. &n=
bsp;
<BR>
<BR>You would probably enjoy two website articles about "quilt myths" writte=
n by Anne Johnson. Anne, now retired, spent her life teaching grade school.=20=
On her two websites she explores the history of quilts and the women who cre=
ated them through brief articles and links to pictures and other sources of=20=
information. These are excellent sites for beginning quilt history enthusias=
ts, as well as grade school students. Parents can use these bits of women's=20=
history to help their children on
<BR>projects at home.

<BR>TIPS FROM A PIECEFUL QUILTER: by Kim Hazlett
<BR>
<BR>Fabric Choices
<BR>
<BR>Many of us love quilting, but usually voice our opinion loudly to all qu=
ilters and shop owners about how hard it is to pick out the colors for a qui=
lt. &nbsp;Personally, I would rather pick out 20 fabrics for a quilt than to=
 pick out only 3 choices - more is better in my book. &nbsp;How do you start=
 to pick out the perfect fabrics for your quilt? &nbsp;First you need a star=
ter fabric, the fabric you just saw, fell in love with and have to take home=
. &nbsp;This fabric should be a multi colored fabric with your favorite colo=
rs in a medium to large-scale print. &nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>For example you have picked a beautiful Hoffman batik with olive green,=20=
blue, some brown and little gold flecks. &nbsp;I will then drape this scrump=
tious fabric somewhere in the shop (with the owners permission) and then add=
 a dark, medium and light value of the main color, olive green. &nbsp;I will=
 then add a dark, medium and a medium light value of the blue. &nbsp;The gol=
d will be my accent color and the brown could be my background color in a li=
ght value. &nbsp;Now use the most important tool you own and that would be y=
our feet - Walk Away from the pile of fabric at least 10 feet and then turn=20=
around, and squint. This simple exercise will reveal which colors pop out or=
 are too similar. &nbsp;Squinting takes out some of the color and lets you s=
ee the value of the fabrics and how they work together. &nbsp;If one of the=20=
colors is screaming to get out of the pile then pull it out. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Also remember it is important to blend your colors and NOT to match them=
 perfectly with your starter fabric. &nbsp;Walking away from your fabric and=
 then looking at the colors will give you a good idea if your quilt is going=
 to sing or if it is a dull quilt.=20
<BR>Keep adding and subtracting to your pile until you have the required num=
ber of fabrics you need. This is when I suggest you walk away again and go l=
ook at a book, pattern or just talk to another quilter in the store for a mi=
nute. &nbsp;Then return back to your colors and make any final adjustments t=
o your colors. &nbsp;Walking away and focusing on something else gives your=20=
eye a fresh look at the selection. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>One other rule to consider is to be sure you love your fabrics, if you l=
ove your fabrics you will love your quilt. &nbsp;If there is one fabric you=20=
are not sure of, then make the change now. &nbsp;After you have looked, pull=
ed, looked, pulled some more fabric and finally come to the decision of the=20=
colors, then march right up to the counter and say cut me.
<BR>
<BR>Many times the multicolored fabric that I had to have does not make it o=
n the front of the quilt since the color palette I used from it can stand on=
 its own and does not need the starter fabric anymore. &nbsp;That is when th=
e starter fabric now becomes the backing fabric of my quilt making the back=20=
of my quilt just as interesting as the front of my quilt. &nbsp;&nbsp;The co=
lors for The Goose Has Left the Pond quilt (<A HREF=3D"http://www.piecefuldr=
eams.com/pdhtml/index.html">www.piecefuldreams.com</A>)=20
<BR>were picked from the starter fabric and then this incredible fabric made=
 its debut on the back of the quilt.=20
<BR>
<BR>I could not discuss all the considerations for picking out the perfect f=
abrics in this one article so you will hear from me again on this subject. &=
nbsp;Just be on the lookout for that incredible fabric that is looking for a=
 good home - yours.
