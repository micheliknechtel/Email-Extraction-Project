Greetings Fellow Java Junkies,

An awful case of child abuse from the state of Kansas has 
caused an increased sense of alert among its citizens and
officials.

Two foster parents are charged with the murder of their 9-year-
old child after he was found dead from suffocation. Now the 
state's welfare system is under investigation. Assuredly, many
are asking, "How could something like this happen?"

While in no way should this case be disregarded at any level,
the state of Kansas' foster care system has reported that only
one percent of children have been shown to be abused. However,
when such a case as this pops up, it prompts officials to 
investigate to find out if more incidents are occurring. 

Taking into account the horrible crime that was committed and
the statistic reported by the state, should an in-depth, and
likely costly, investigation take place?

           KANSAS ABUSE CASE RAISES MANY QUESTIONS          

In the wake of the death of a young boy in Kansas, a lot of 
questions about that state's welfare system are being asked. 
But an investigation into what happened to 9-year-old "Brian" 
might be difficult. He was in the custody of foster parents 
in Kansas at the time. The Kansas City (Mo.) Star says that 
many personal records of state-run childcare are not open to 
the public. In neighboring Missouri that is not the case.
What the Star does know is that the boy had been given over 
to the care of a couple named Neil and Christy Edgar. The boy 
would eventually be found dead, his mouth taped shut, the 
victim of suffocation. Just last week the couple was officially 
charged with first-degree murder. Only 1 percent of children 
in the foster care system of Kansas have been shown to be 
abused. But many around the state are asking for a more 
thorough examination of the entire process to prevent other 
horrible incidents from happening ... to protect future 
"Brians" from meeting a similar fate.

              DEGAS GETTING HIS DAY IN PHILLY               

The latest exhibition of the works of Edgar Degas will soon 
open its doors in Philadelphia. The Inquirer notes that the 
name Degas will always be synonymous with "dance." This latest 
exhibition of the artist's work focuses in on myriad aspects 
of Terpsichore. More than half of the works of art that Degas 
completed before his death had something to do with dance or 
dancers. The publication's Edward J. Sozanski says that Degas 
managed to create some of "Western art's most transcendent 
images of dancers and dance performance." Due to open early 
next month, the Degas showing will be mounted at the 
Philadelphia Museum of Art. A co-organizer of the exhibit is 
the Detroit Institute of the Arts, which will display the works 
after they leave Philadelphia. The exhibit has more than 120 
pieces by Degas and is officially named "Degas and the Dance."

         WINE COUNTRY SHOWS UPSWING IN DUI ARRESTS         

When all the police records were compiled for the just-passed 
holidays, drivers in California wine country did not fare well. 
Statistics processed by all-news station KCBS in San Francisco 
show that there was a huge increase in DUI arrests in Sonoma 
County over the holiday weekends, compared with a year earlier. 
The station says that while arrests in much of the San Fran-
cisco Bay area were up only slightly (most had a 1 percent 
rise), DUIs in Sonoma County were up by a whopping 60 percent.
Nearly 200 motorists were stopped by police to check out what 
appeared to be instances of drunken driving. One police 
official told the station that most officers are tired of 
having to knock on doors over holiday weekends to tell the 
people inside that a loved one has been injured or killed in 
an alcohol-related accident. The increase in drivers taken off 
the roads, particularly in Sonoma, might account for the fact 
that there was only a slight increase in the number of 
accidents in the multi-county area, as compared with a year 
earlier.

More on the West Virginia "Bumpkins":

Brian, for what it's worth, the Pep Band at UVa has always been 
irreverent and makes fun of everyone, not just West Virginia. 
When I was in the band in 1975 we were banned from playing at 
Maryland games for a year because of a joke about their gover-
nor going to jail. I'll admit, it all seemed funnier when I 
was a student, but I don't think it was meant maliciously.
-Meg M.

Another example of too thin-skinned people who are too easily 
offended.  What about the sterotypes of Texans, Oklahomans, 
Arkansas residents, Mississippi, the Scandinavians in 
Minnesota/North Dakota/Wisconsin, Mormons in Utah, gangsters 
in New Jersey, and on and on and on.  Do we have so little to 
seriously be concerned about that we must take umbrage at every 
little slight?  Folks, get over it!!!!   People have been 
stereotyping Texans and Okies for years-----why is everyone 
trying to move down here, then????
-Proud native Texan.

Dear Brian, 
There is NO way, repeat, NO way to the Nth power, that schools 
can prevent insults like one school team calling another 
"Bumpkins" and worse. We, as a species, are just too hardwired 
to keep on 'dissing' each other. Is there ANY statement that 
cannot be considered an insult? School rivalry has been going 
on since the education institute started. Just tell everyone 
to grow a thick skin and stop taking yourself too seriously 
if you want to make your mark in the world of education, 
sports, business, or anywhere else. The question of insult 
would not even be an issue in most cases, except for the hor-
rendous lawsuits over it. If the USA adopted England's legal 
statue saying that the loser of such ridiculous class action 
suits must PAY for all the court and lawyer costs if he loses, 
these endless and unbelievably expensive to the taxpayer non-
sense suits would be almost non-existent. The only reason we 
don't do that in America is because it would mean less work 
for the lawyers! 
-Bob S.
