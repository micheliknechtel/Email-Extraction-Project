Bush's massive economic stimulus plan, which could include the
elimination of taxes on dividends.

DUE DILIGENCE: BUSH PLAN STOKES MARKET

WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- It didn't take a proposal to cut shareholder
taxes by $300 billion to put the once-ignored corporate dividend back in

THOM CALANDRA'S STOCKWATCH: FOREIGN-LINKED CDS DELIVER CASH, YIELD AND
GAINS

The dollar’s slide, coupled with the lowest money-market interest rates
in more than 30 years, points to an investment that is far off the radar
screen for most individual Americans: foreign-currency certificates of
deposit.

CAUTION NEEDED IN ASSESSING TOP DIVIDEND PAYERS

NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- A look at the top 15 dividend payers among
America’s largest companies would make any investor salivate --
especially since returns would be enhanced if President Bush’s expected
proposal to cut dividend taxes goes through.
But caution is needed in assessing these firms.
