Resolve to Rebalance Your Portfolio
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Have you broken your New Year's resolutions yet? Even if you have, 
we have one change you can still make: rebalance your portfolio 
by the end of the month. It might not trip off the tongue as 
easily as "exercise" or "get a new job," but rebalancing can 
make a significant difference to your financial future.

Why rebalance? Because by occasionally adjusting your stock, bond 
and cash holdings back to a fixed percentage of total investment, 
you could reduce your investment risk. Leave your investments 
alone, and sooner or later, one of your assets can grow to a 
large percentage of the total -- leaving you vulnerable to that 
asset's decline (remember 2001?).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Guiding Your Assets
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Asset allocation is the first step to rebalancing. Using it, you 
decide the level of risk with which you're comfortable. In essence, 
you choose what percentage of your total investment dollars will 
go toward certain stock, bond and cash categories. These asset 
categories are groups of securities that are expected to rise or 
fall together. A certain mix of assets may give you higher return 
with higher risk, while another historically has a more moderate 
return but less likelihood of loss. A well-diversified portfolio 
usually means less risk than one that's weighted heavily toward 
one or two asset classes. Use the Asset Allocation Guide in the 
Investing area of Quicken Deluxe, Quicken Premier, or Quicken 
Home & Business to get started. Learn about various allocations, 
how to make adjustments to your personal asset allocation, plus 
how to monitor that allocation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
When Should You Rebalance?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Once you've decided on your asset allocation, you can choose 
when to rebalance. Some advisors suggest rebalancing on a 
quarterly or yearly schedule; others prefer to rebalance when 
your allocation drifts too far from your predetermined percentage. 
Whichever strategy you choose, Quicken software can help you 
here, too. If you've already entered your investments into your 
Quicken software, the Portfolio Rebalancer shows your current 
asset mix alongside your target mix (click on "How do I rebalance 
my portfolio" in the Asset Allocation Guide).

Whether you decide to rebalance every 18 months or when your 
asset balance drifts too far off your intended target, the 
important thing is that you do it regularly. Ignore your assets 
too long and you may have an unpleasant surprise waiting for you.
