BrightStor(tm) Portal: Problem with the
BrightStor(tm) Storage Resource Manager=20
Client Launch from BrightStor Portal

Problem Description:
Unable to launch the BrightStor Storage Resource Manager (BrightStor =
SRM) Windows client using a Remote Desktop Control (RDC) Published file. =


Problem Resolution:
Generate a batch file (see below) and copy it to BrightStor SRM =
Application server. Use the BrightStor SRM server path for the batch =
file when setting up the RDC Published file to launch BrightStor SRM =
from the Published RDC.
Example:
CD "D:\Program Files\CA\BrightStor SRM\Software\Bin"
"D:\Program Files\CA\BrightStor SRM\Software\Bin\BrightStor SRM.exe" /V=20
"D:\BRIGHT~1\Central"=20

Make sure it points to the correct drive and directories where the =
BrightStor SRM is installed (bin) and its database resides (central).
*Note: The batch can be outside the BrightStor SRM folders.=20

BrightStor(tm) ARCserve=AE Backup v7 for NetWare:=20
How to Backup a NetWare Cluster Volume

When backing up a Novell 5.x or 6.x cluster volume with BrightStor =
ARCserve 7.0 for NetWare, you must use the TSA switch of /cluster=3Doff. =
Please refer to Novell TID# 10070753 and TID# 10065605, point #2. =
Without this setting, you could possibly encounter data loss.
*Note: Future releases of BrightStor ARCserve Backup will support =
cluster fail over and will not need this switch.=20

Off-Site Rules for BrightStor(tm) CA-Vtape(tm)
Virtual Tape System, BrightStor(tm) CA-Dynam=AE/TLMS(tm) Tape Management =
Combination Users

Currently, combination users of BrightStor CA-Vtape and BrightStor =
CA-Dynam/TLMS do not have an easy way to support the coding of off-site =
rules for remote vaulting of the back stored virtual tapes. BrightStor =
CA-Vtape generates a name of "hlq.VVE.Vvolser.PRIMARY" or =
"hlq.VVE.Vvolser.DUPLEX" for all back stored virtual volumes. HLQ is the =
high level qualifier the product was installed with and VOLSER is the =
virtual tape volume serial number. All back store groups use the same =
pattern and HLQ.=20

BrightStor CA-Dynam/TLMS off-site rules only support a single wildcard =
at the end of the data set name pattern entered. Since the BrightStor =
CA-Vtape generated name has the variable volser in front of the DUPLEX =
name node, the BrightStor CA-Dynam/TLMS wildcard pattern cannot flag =
just the DUPLEX tapes for off-site movement.=20

Both products have enhancements planned to address this issue. =
Meanwhile, a workaround is required until those enhancements are =
delivered. BrightStor CA-Dynam/TLMS support has coded an exit that =
reverses the last two nodes of the BrightStor CA-Vtape generated name so =
that a rule can be coded for "hlq.VVE.DUPLEX.Vvolser" when the off-site =
rules are being applied.=20

The exit is currently being tested successfully at various client sites. =
If you would like to receive a copy of the exit or learn more about the =
exit, please contact the BrightStor CA-Dynam/TLMS Technical Support =
group by calling 1-800-645-3042 (U.S. and Canada) or your local support =
office.=20
