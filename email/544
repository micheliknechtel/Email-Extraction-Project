Dear Lover of Romance:
 
The beauty of unexpected passion is that it takes you by surprise. But the
danger of unexpected passion is that it...well, you can guess that one,
can't you? If not, just ask Mona Graham or David Anderson or Julie Carlson
what happens when love arrives unexpectedly.
 
*   *   *
Mona Graham is a mystic on a quest for an ancient treasure. Patrick Maxwell
is a rogue knight who's a sworn enemy to her family. She chooses him to
accompany her on a fateful journey, with the promise of peace at last
between their two clans. That is, if the two of them survive the
journey...and their own desire. Medieval romance lights up the Dark Ages in
Jen Holling's CAPTURED BY YOUR KISS!

Funny, fantastic film noir meets sexy, smart romance in NOBODY BUT YOU.
Bestselling author Julie Kenner tells the tale of David Anderson, a P.I.
who's nowhere near as smooth as the fictional dick he describes in his own
dimestore novels. But when a sassy redhead really does stroll into his
office, he may just be in for a truly tough case...and even a little romance
as well!

Julie Carlson suspects her husband of cheating...again. Mac McQuarry's a
P.I. who knows how to get the goods. And though he knows better than to mix
business with pleasure, Julie is one damsel in distress he just can't
resist--not to mention he already has a score to settle with her husband.
But when a hit is put out on Julie, the stakes are upped...who to trust?
Trust Karen Robards to make TO TRUST A STRANGER true can't-put-down reading.
