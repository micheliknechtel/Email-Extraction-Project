Today's List-A-Day Review: Heloise's Hints

You know who Heloise is. She's the one woman in the world who can
tell you how to get chewing gum out of the carpet, find a use for
all those plastic newspaper bags and help you run your life better.
Heloise is now online and ready to send you a hint a day.

Heloise -- actually the daughter of the original Heloise, who 
along with Ann Landers and Dear Abby once ruled the roost among 
advice columnists -- dispenses one useful hint a day, to help make 
your home a nicer place to live, give your clothes a longer lease 
on life or make your pet a more welcome member of the household.

In addition, she shares a bit of her personal life, with a picture
of a beloved bit, a baby photo and the like. What does that have 
to do with hints on dusting and storing paint? Not much, but it
helps Heloise establish a closer connection with her readers.
