Prieveiksmis - bu-tent (boo'-tent)
  the adverb - namely, exactly

      This, to me, falls under the category of 'parenthetic words and 
phrases', which are things we add to our speech to make it more 
colourful. They make it more interesting.

          Kas bu-tent? - Who exactly?
        
          Kur bu-tent? - Where exactly?
