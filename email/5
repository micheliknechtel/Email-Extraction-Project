The #1 Publication on Internet Fraud

By Audri and Jim Lanford
C o p y r i g h t (c) 2003 Audri and Jim Lanford.
All rights reserved.

Issue # 58 January 17, 2003

Hi all:

First, we'd like to wish you a very happy New Year. We hope
you had a wonderful holiday season.

We have some very important info for you this month. We've got
news about avoiding fraudulent escrow companies when buying
expensive items through online auctions, fake college degrees
and how to spot them, how to fight back if you've been scammed
on the Internet, more on identity theft, online dating as a
source for spammers, and a cybercrime glossary.

First, however, there is a brand new product we'd like to
share with any of you interested in losing weight. Audri had
taken Terri Levine's Ideal Body tele-seminar last year and was
so impressed she wanted to help Terri spread this information.
(Audri has lost 12 pounds so far using Terri's approach -- and
it's been easy, healthy, inexpensive, and -- believe it or not
-- even fun!)

That's because Terri's approach doesn't involve dieting,
exercise, or pills.

Audri did a series of interviews with Terri on weight loss
without struggle -- how to create your ideal body. You can
learn more about the resulting new ebook at:

==> http://www.1shoppingcart.com/app/aftrack.asp?afid=63575

Remember, it's these promotions that keep Internet ScamBusters
free. And, we will only offer products to you we personally
use and believe in 100%.

OK, let's get started...

Internet ScamBusters "Snippets"
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Fraudulent Escrow Services Leave Buyers In the Lurch

If you buy items at auction through eBay or other online
auction services, you'll want to pay attention to this one.

For expensive goods (say, over $1,000), many auctioneers and
bidders use an 'escrow' system. Escrow means that the winning
bidder sends the cash to a neutral third party (an escrow
company) to be held, usually until the goods are shipped and
the bidder is satisfied with their condition.

The benefit is that the escrow company is supposed to be a
neutral party to the transaction, a middleman, that protects
both the auctioneer and the bidder in case something goes
wrong. Of course, there is a charge for this service.

Well, some folks are taking advantage of this system to bilk
bidders out of thousands of dollars.

It's scarily simple: the scammers, working in cahoots with the
auctioneer, set up a phony escrow company, complete with its
own Web site. When you 'place the money in escrow,' you're
just sending it to scammers, who then use stalling tactics to
explain why the auction hasn't cleared escrow. Eventually they
fold their tents and flee, and you're left thousands of
dollars poorer and with no recourse.

Here are some tips to avoid getting scammed by this fake
escrow scheme:

1. Use an escrow service recommended by the online auction
site (for example, eBay recommends Escrow.com).

2. If the seller wants you to use a specific escrow company,
ask why. Be sure to check it out carefully.

3. If anything seems fishy, find another escrow company.

Fake College Degrees Put You At Risk

You probably remember seeing the tiny classified ads in the
back of magazines: Get a college degree now, based on your
'life experience' or other credentials!

Of course, this was just a scheme where you paid some 'degree
mill' money to get a pretty printed certificate saying that
you'd graduated from a non-existent institution, or an
institution that just exists to give out diplomas to anyone
with a credit card.

Well, times have changed, but the scam hasn't -- it's just
become more high-tech. Many sites on the Internet offer to
give you a college diploma for cash. Some are so brazen that
they're called Fake Degrees or Fake Diplomas. So you know
you're not getting a high-quality education.

Why, then, are you at risk? Well, if you're hiring employees,
you want to make sure their credentials are real and that
they're up to the task.

And if you're going to see a lawyer, doctor, or other
professional, it's vital that they be certified from a real
educational institution. Otherwise, you could be in for
trouble.

If you have any doubts as to whether someone's diploma is
legitimate, check out the U.S. Network for Education
Information's Web site at:

==> http://www.ed.gov/NLE/USNEI/us/accred-fraud.html

Sometimes, doing a search on the 'college' or 'university'
name on Google.com will also turn up fraudulent institutions.

If You've Been Scammed On the Internet, Fight Back!

A lot of people who've been scammed or swindled feel too
embarrassed to report that they've been ripped off.

Often, they feel that if they had just been smarter, they
would have avoided being scammed, and they keep silent for
fear of being judged.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Smart people get
scammed too (take a look at the recent Enron and WorldCom
scandals). That's also one of the reasons we're so public when
we get scammed -- we want you to realize that even the
creators of Internet ScamBusters get taken now and then!

Plus, criminals spend all their time thinking up schemes and
illegal plans -- there's a reason they call it the 'criminal
mind.'

It's important to be vigilant, but it's also important to
report being scammed if it happens to you. You may be able to
get all or some of your money back, and at the least, you may
prevent others from being scammed in the future.

If you've been scammed on the Internet, your first stop should
be the Internet Fraud Complaint Center (IFCC):

==> http://www1.ifccfbi.gov/index.asp

The IFCC is a partnership between the FBI and the National
White Collar Crime Center. You can file a complaint and view
fraud tips and warnings.

TechTV's Cybercrime Center also has a great list of agencies
and resources you can use to report your problem in more
depth, and find out what the government can do and is doing to
stop cyber fraud:

More Resources on Identity Theft

You may have heard this on the news right after we published
our last issue: federal prosecutors busted what's been called
the largest identity theft fraud ring in history:

==> http://www.wired.com/news/privacy/0,1848,56567,00.html

Over two years, thousands of people were bilked out of
millions of dollars. In today's networked electronic age,
you've got to be alert to the problem, and you have to take
steps to protect yourself.

Just by knowing your name, address, and some other bits of
information, swindlers can impersonate you electronically and
make purchases, withdraw money, and wreak havoc on your credit
rating.

The U.S. government has put together a good Web site to teach
you what identity theft is, how to protect yourself against
it, and how to report it at:

==> http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft/

If you are a TriWest HealthCare Alliance beneficiary, be sure
to visit this page immediately.

And, if you've been a victim of identity theft, be sure to
file a complaint with the FTC, who can investigate fraud. File
your complaint at:

Online Romance Can Lead to Spam

This one's just sad.

Many people use the Internet to find love and romance, using
online personals and matchmaking sites. Now, spammers have
latched onto this, and instead of finding the love of your
life, you may be giving up your email address to those who
fill your inbox with junk.

Here's what we've heard: You may get an email from a site
claiming to hook up shy people with the subjects of their
crushes. Someone likes you! Now all you have to do is go to
the Web site, enter your email address (and in some cases, the
addresses of your friends), and you'll find out who's got that
crush on you.

Well, you've guessed it. This type of Web site seems to be a
front for spammers who are collecting email addresses for
their spam lists. A couple of people who did this with email
addresses they created just to test this *immediately* started
getting spammed as soon as they entered the information on the
so-called 'crush site.'

Many crush sites seem to be legitimate -- but some are not.
Be careful before you give your email address.

The moral of the story? Don't let the promise of a
love-smitten admirer cause you to give up your email address.
Remember, if they're really interested in you, they'll contact
you themselves!

A Glossary of Cybercrime

Not sure what the difference between a hacker and a cracker
is, or a 'white hat' and a 'black hat'? Confused by some of
the jargon or high-tech terms in articles about Internet fraud?

Take a look at the excellent Cybercrime Glossary at:

Why Diets Don't Work...

If you've ever been on a diet (and who hasn't!), you've
probably felt deprived. You're supposed to only eat specific
foods, a set number of calories, low fat foods, low carb
foods, and so on. Or, you are supposed to eat foods that
taste like shoe leather. ;-)

Enough!
