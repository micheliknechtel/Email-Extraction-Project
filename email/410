***IS SHE REALLY HERE?

Our daughter was born three months ago, and sometimes I still can't believe
she's really here. Perhaps this is a normal reaction for first-time
mothers, but I can't seem to shake this feeling of disbelief. You see, my
husband, Steve, and I traveled a long road of heartache, fear, and
apprehension leading up to the birth of our daughter, Olivia.

Steve and I were married a couple of years ago. We are in our mid-30s, so
we felt a sense of urgency about starting a family. We were fortunate, and
got pregnant relatively quickly. At first we were nervous, and like many
couples, waited a long time to share the news. By the second trimester,
everything was going well, so we announced the big news, and began to relax
and enjoy the pregnancy. We finally allowed ourselves to picture our new
baby and our life as a family. But then, in the second trimester, we lost
the pregnancy--a baby girl. Any couple who has been through this experience
knows the indescribable sense of loss and grief.

It took us many months to prepare ourselves emotionally to go through it
again. Our second pregnancy was a lesson in hope, patience, and endurance.
In addition to relentless morning sickness, I was giving myself shots twice
a day to treat a blood condition (the possible cause of the miscarriage).
But the pain of the shots was minimal compared to the overwhelming sense of
fear and the agonizingly slow passage of time. Unlike our first pregnancy,
we were unable to talk about baby names or nurseries, let alone picture
what she might be like. We were still anxious, even into the final weeks of
the pregnancy, and found it very hard to imagine a new baby in our lives.
The first time I really felt that rush of joyful anticipation was the week
before my c-section. Sometimes I wondered if I was depriving myself of the
happiness of pregnancy, but I knew these feelings were beyond my control.


***GENERAL CHILDCARE ADVICE AND TIPS

Despite our trepidation, we eventually read the books and took the classes.
But, of course, nothing could have prepared us for taking care of a baby.
From the smaller questions ("Is her stump EVER going to fall off?") to the
bigger ones ("Is she getting enough to eat?"), there were many issues we
never anticipated. Here are a few tips from the Workshop that give
practical childcare advice:

***A NEW LANGUAGE: COMMUNICATING WITH BABY

As any new parent knows, figuring out how to change a diaper is one thing,
but it's another thing entirely to know when your baby is sleepy (or hungry
or gassy or simply bored). The books and experts told us that we would soon
learn to decipher all our baby's cries. But in the early days, all her
cries sounded alike to me--sad and urgent. Was I a bad mother? Was I out of
sync with my baby's needs? Soon enough (and with some help from my husband)
I learned to read Olivia's cries and cues and was better at understanding
her needs. Of course, I'm sure I sometimes mistake a "hungry" cry with a
"tired" cry, but I feel more confident these days. In turn, I'm working on
how I communicate and interact with her. Whether in play, talk, or simply
touch, I try to communicate in a loving, consistent, and reassuring way.
These articles provide an interesting look at how you connect with your
baby.

***A NEW YEAR, A NEW LIFE

It's amazing what a difference a year makes. This time last year we were
hoping for a new baby, and now we're deep in the throes of parenthood. As
we enter 2003, I find that my resolutions are a bit more introspective than
in the past. How can I be a good mother? How can I create a safe, happy,
and engaging environment for Olivia? These articles from the Workshop
provide a nice perspective on being a parent:

***SESAME STREET MUSIC WORKS

Olivia can often be found listening to The Beatles and Miles Davis, but we
also recognize the unique role classical music can play. In addition to all
the developmental advantages, a little Bach or Mozart played softly in the
background helps all of us wind down at the end of the day. And as we start
to institute a bedtime routine, classical music during her bath and final
feeding of the day serves as a nice signal to Olivia. A few friends have
given us classical CDs created just for babies. We were skeptical at first,
but quickly realized that these "baby CDs" have been carefully selected to
include just the softer, melodic songs. No huge crescendos just as your
baby's drifting off to sleep!


***SESAME STREET BEAT

This week Aladdin visits Sesame Street and shows Elmo and Zoe how his genie
can make anything happen. But when the genie takes the day off, Aladdin
thinks he cannot do anything for himself.

Tune in on Friday, January 10 and see if Elmo and Zoe can show Aladdin that
he can do a lot of things for himself. Then try these fun Elmo and Zoe
activities.

Aladdin's visit is based on the fairy tale of Aladdin's Lamp. What other
Sesame Street friend began his or her Sesame Street career as a character
in a fairy-tale segment?

A. Oscar
B. Rosita
C. Zoe
D. Baby Bear

The answer is (D) Baby Bear. His first few appearances on Sesame Street
were part of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" segments. Because Baby Bear
was such a hit, he became a separate character on the show!


***HOLDING ON TO THAT SENSE OF WONDER

As we enter month four of parenthood, we are still amazed that Olivia is
really here. And the fact that she's a big, healthy, beautiful baby is more
than we could have hoped for. I'll never believe that the loss of our first
pregnancy was "for the best" as some people claim, but I do think that the
experience has given us a greater sense of awe and appreciation for our new
daughter--a feeling that I hope we never lose.
