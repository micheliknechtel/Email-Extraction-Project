TODAY'S TIP: ACT Reading -- Last Resort Strategy

If you're having real difficulty with a passage or simply running
out of time, try the "potshot approach" as a last
resort:

If questions on a passage refer to line numbers and you have only
a few minutes left (and you haven't read the passage), simply
read the questions that refer to specific lines in the passage
and read only those specific sections of the passage (potshot
them) to try to answer the question. This final strategy may help
you at least eliminate some answer choices and add one or two
right answers to your score. And always remember to put down at
least a guess answer for all ACT questions.
