                         FAMILY TRAVEL FORUM online

======================================================================
Dear Family Travelers and Travel Professionals,

"Buon Anno!", as they say in Italy. My family is back at work and 
school after a wonderful week at Club Valtur Setriere in the Alps, 
where we skied, snowboarded, laughed and ate our way through the 
best vacation ever. From the super kids club, to the fantastic 
chefs, excellent snowsports instructors and energized entertainment, 
Valtur's equipe (and every Italian we met on subsequent travels) 
went out of their way to make us feel welcomed.  FYI, the snow 
will be magnifico until April.

I can't wait to hear about your holidays and the latest travel 
tales. Please tell!  And those who received new cameras can 
also send in best (or worst) travel photos to become our 
FTF Postcards.

We wish a peaceful and productive '03 filled with happy travels 
and lasting memories to all.
