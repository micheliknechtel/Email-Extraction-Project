HAPPY NEW YEAR, SVDCers!

Welcome to 2003!  I hope your holidays were wonderful, happy, and, in =
some cases, I know many of us enjoyed the first white Christmas in =
several years!  If your New Year's Resolutions include meeting new =
people and volunteering, here is the perfect opportunity to start =
fulfilling them!  Events through January 20 are now open.  Visit =
www.singlevolunteers.org/dc for a complete list and to sign up for =
events.

Events for this weekend include:

1/9  Food and Friends (open for men and women!)
1/11 Landscaping at ANS (open for men and women!)
1/11 Sprucing up an Afterschool Facility (open for men and women!)
1/11 National Zoo (open for men)
1/19 Samaritan Inn's Fellowship Dinner

Opening shortly will be:

1/18  SHARE (need a team leader)
1/18 Food Prep at Fairfax FISH/Calvary Hill
1/20 Martin Luther King Service Day (need team leader)

Due to popular demand, SVDC will be offering Lost Dog and Cat Rescue =
event on Sunday, January 19.  All other dates will remain on Friday.  =
However, all events need team leaders.  Sign ups cannot be accepted =
until a team leader is assigned. =20

Please keep in mind: =20

-Sign ups should be sent to the team leader listed.  If the event reads =
"not open for sign ups," please wait until the team leader's name and =
email is posted to sign up.
-If you sign up for an event, you are committed to showing up, on time =
and staying for the entire event.  Unless otherwise noted, most events =
are rain or shine.  Please contact the team leader before assuming an =
event is cancelled due to weather. =20
-All events are first-come, first-serve and some will fill up quickly.  =
If your first choice isn't available, we encourage you to see if another =
event needs volunteers. =20

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

I look forward to seeing you all out volunteering very soon!

Pam
January Queen Bee
