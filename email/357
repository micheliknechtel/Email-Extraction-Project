greetings everyone. I am so excited to have joined the group. I am in 
the Chicago area and I am looking to connect with people like myself 
who are involved with spiritual worlds. I am Reiki practitioner, 
Kabbalistic Healer, Hypnosis Therapist (concentration in past life 
regressions) and I am currently learning to channel. I need help in 
that area. anyone interested in taking on a student? please let me 
know. eagerly awaiting. Lana.
