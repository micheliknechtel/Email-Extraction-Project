NEW ARCADE GAME UNIPONG LAUNCHES
http://www.dexterity.com/unipong/

We just released our second new game of the year today:  Unipong.  In Unipong you perform tricks with a ping pong ball and paddle.  The controls are very simple -- just use the mouse to control the paddle, and keep the ball in the air as long as you can.  To score points you perform tricks, like tossing the paddle in the air, catching the ball on the paddle, bouncing the ball on the edge of the paddle, spinning the paddle, and so on.  As your skill improves, you learn to execute combos that chain multiple tricks together.  The game includes a tournament mode that leads you through dozens of different objectives, indoor and outdoor environments, and different types of paddles with unique physics.

I first saw a prototype of this game at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in May 2002.  The developer expressed interest in a publishing deal, but I wasn't sure if the final version would be fun enough.  When we received the final version of the game, we were impressed to say the least.  Not only was the game exceptionally fun, but we were absolutely amazed at the dozens of different tricks you can perform.  It's as if the developer started with the basic idea of bouncing a ping pong ball on a paddle and just kept going.  You can even activate a special "flow" mode where everything goes in slow motion while you tackle some really outrageous tricks.

Unipong is definitely one of the most original games you'll play this year.  If you're looking for a game where you can just dive right in and start having fun without making a huge commitment, give Unipong a try.  Chances are you've never played anything like it.

DEXTERITY.COM WEB SITE UPDATED
http://www.dexterity.com/

To make our web site easier for you to navigate, we've redesigned and streamlined many pages of the site.  First, our home page is no longer a mega-list of every game on our site.  Now the games are organized into separate pages for each genre:  puzzle games, arcade games, and strategy games.  You can find convenient links to each section from the left sidebar on every page of the site.  This new design allows us to continue to release more games (Unipong was #19) without overwhelming our home page with a huge list of games.  We've also rewritten our home page to better express our unique philosophy.


MORE FREE GAME LEVELS
http://www.dexterity.com/forums/

If you haven't visited our player discussion forums lately, you might be missing out on some free game levels.  Several new levels for Dweep Gold and Aargon Deluxe Gold have been posted by players in the past couple months, and most include solutions.  So be sure to visit the forums and download your free levels if you already own these games.  Also, if you've created any levels of your own you'd like to share, please feel free to post them so that others may enjoy them too.


Thanks for playing!
