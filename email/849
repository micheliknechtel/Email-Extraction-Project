Hello, my name is Melonie and I am a 29 year old,
married, stay at home mom of 3... Kaitlyn-10, PJ-7 and
Megan-4. (Married 10 years this past June!) I reside
in the Baltimore MD. area and along with caring for my
own children I help look after my best friends 3 as
well.... I guess you could say I am a busy girl! I
love crafting, reading, putting together children's
parties and yoga. I am an internet guru and a writer
by hobby and would love to find some other mom's to
write and chat with to stay sane!...lol<br>

Hi... My name is Heather, and I'm a 28 year old working 
mom who feels as if I'm missing out on quality time with 
my daughter.  I'm a fifth grade teacher and mom to 7 
month old Allison.  Alli is a happy baby, and has 
adjusted well to spending time with her sitter.  I think 
being a working mom is more difficult on me than my 
daughter.  I find myself resenting the time I spend 
preparing for work after work hours.  I would love to 
hear from others who are in the same type of situation, 
who may be able to offer advice or simply 
commiserate.<br>

Hello. My name is Melonie. I am 31 yrs. old. I am a 
mother of 4. I have two stepdaughters and a daughter 
and a son whom I gave birth to. To me they are 
all 4 mine (they all live with us). I enjoy scapbooking, 
and working outside with my flowers and plants. I am a 
real outdoor person and winter drives me crazy! 
I would like to have an epal that has a teenager 
(preferably a step child) who I can chat with so I know 
that I am not the only parent going through the teen 
years! (I sure don't remember them being so tough).

Frugal Home
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm not sure your would consider this frugal or not, but 
I have a nice way to get my husband off in the 
morning.  I use one weekend morning a month to 
make 'breakfast' for my husand to grab on the way 
out.  I make a double batch of pancakes, freezing half 
of them in pairs with a pat of butter between and a 
little syrup on top, and freezing the other half wrapped 
around a sausage link.  I also take a bulk package of 
large tortillas, 2 dozen eggs, a Wal-Mart brand bulk size 
of shredded monterey\colby cheese, and bulk size 
salsa.  I make and freeze individual breakfast tacos.  
This gives my hubby plenty of selection through the 
month to grab on his way out.  His breakfast has a 
chance to thaw just slightly on the way to work and he 
pops his breakfast in the microwave once he gets there 
(minus the foil of course!!!!)!  When I find a sale, I buy 
and make extra to deep freeze breakfast items so that 
they last longer!!!!<p>
