            <i>Being forced to select an identifier prior to choosing products
            makes me very suspicious that the price will be different depending
            on what I say, or that some products may not be shown to me at all,
            based on the corporation's stereotype of what customers in different
            classifications need.</i></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I so agree with this statement. What
            I find even more irritating is when I want to get a quick price
            quote and have to fill in everything from my name and address to my
            second cousin's favorite ice cream flavor. I am rarely ready to buy
            until I have done proper research, and I often will leave a web site
            when the "irritation factor" of form filling gets too
            high.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For that reason, I ensure that price
            and format of my products is up front. I'll do business with someone
            I trust; I expect people will do business with me if I am up front

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I agree with Marcia about being
            forced to identify yourself as a certain category of customer before
            buying a product. I hate it. I recently bought a computer using the
            Gateway website, and wanted to configure the system myself (that is
            what Gateway is all about, right?). But they did not easily let me
            do it that way. Long story short, I found a system - configured it -
            saved the quote.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Then *called* them because their
            website did not give me enough assurance about when the computer
            would arrive for me to feel right ordering online. I called their
            business number (I am a business, however small, and had configured
            a system through the business section of their site) and got
            shuttled -by a human being, fwiw- over to their consumer line...</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Given that experience, it is my take
            that companies insist on categorizing their customers because it is
            how they operate internally. It's no excuse, though, for not finding
            out how your customers *really* want to use your site... usability
            testing that makes a difference is easy to do... you can find and
            cure 80% of the problems by watching and taking notes as 5-6 people
            use your site... (one way mirrors not required!)</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Marcia has some doubts about the
            process of identifying herself as a "home business, small
            business or big business."</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are indeed some very plausible
            reasons for doing so.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One, as you mentioned, is selecting
            the products to be offered. As a "one-man band" operating
            out of a home office, I have no real need to wade through server
            networks, corporate site licensing, purchase order procedures, and
            so on. If I want to buy a keyboard, I want to see the keyboard, be
            able to order one without background check, and pay with my company
            credit card.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because of the relative simplicity of
            a one-off sale to an individual, the price I pay may actually be
            lower. This information could cause problems for the corporate buyer
            seeking 500 or 1,000 keyboards, along with support, stacked shipping
            dates and so on.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, after taking the long way around,
            I guess my answer is no, I don't mind identifying the group I'm in
            at all.</font></p>

            both office and home furniture through (at the time) 4 distinct
            channels. We spent hours struggling with the "identify
            yourself" issue. The company had dealers targeting big
            business, dealers targeting small businesses, retailers targeting
            home users, and a online store. We used to joke that the business
            model sort of collided, where all the channels had to make sense to
            the site visitor in a 8 second glance on the home page. Pre-web this
            never was an issue.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The reality of the business was that
            each channel had its own mix of products, services, research, sales
            outlets, internal support staff and ultimately (like it or not),
            pricing. In order to effectively lead you - as a site visitor - down
            the sales path at some point we needed to know the answer to 3
            questions; what product were you interested in, what channel would
            best serve you, and where were you located. Your path through the
            site determined the order in which you "provided" the
            answers to those questions.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While designing the site, we were
            aware that many visitors would not want to identify themselves into
            a channel right away. So we provided a path directly to a generic,
            all-inclusive product showroom. By taking this path you inherently
            answered the product question first, then when accessing the dealer
            locator from this generic showroom you then needed to choose a
            channel (and the locator had products mapped to channels, and could
            tell you when a certain product wasn't available through a certain
            channel), and finally a location.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For those willing to self-identify
            right away, other paths from the home page led to channel-specific
            product showrooms. Accessing the dealer locator from these showrooms
            we already could infer the channel and product questions, and
            provided location questions right away.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Was it the most user friendly? No,
            but the site had to adapt itself to the business model. The
            interesting thing is since I was laid off from that team, 2 of the 4
            channels have gone away, simplifying both the business model and the
            site design.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Years ago I read about a professional
            who was very successful in finding business via CompuServe and
            well-liked by his clients, until a picture of him was published in
            the CompuServe print magazine, to illustrate a piece on CompuServe
            success stories. Then business dropped off sharply. His clients
            hadn't realized he was African-American, and some of them evidently
            had a problem with that. A sad and discouraging illustration of
            (some) human nature. Sometimes you are better off to let your words
            and skills speak for you, avoiding whatever prejudices someone may
            bring to a photo.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We all form mental pictures of who
            we're dealing with, even when these are very imaginatively based
            only on impressions from text and assumptions about names. Many
            people in the world don't know what sort of name Deirdre is, and in
            the US Adrian is a female name. So myself and my employee Adrian,
            both active online, were often amused by Americans assuming he was
            female, and others assuming (purely on the basis of my technical
            expertise) that I was male. It became one of the standing jokes in
            the company.</font></p>
