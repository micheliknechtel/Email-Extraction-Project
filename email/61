Time is Money - Money is Time
by Tawra Kellam
Enjoy life

When people ask me about getting out of debt, they often ask
"Doesn't it take quite a bit more time to be frugal?" Of
course, doing work yourself does mean you spend more time
doing certain things. It also means that you will spend a lot
less time and money working to pay someone else to do it. Many
people work more hours to pay someone to do a job than it
would take them to do it themselves. If you make a million
dollars a year and have no manual dexterity, this article is
not for you.

Here are some examples, based on my own experience of a family
of four. Because your household income is probably not the
same as mine, some things that make sense for me will not make
sense for you. I suggest that you read my examples and
consider your actual costs.

Example #1: BUYING CLOTHES - One great way to save on clothes
is to go to garage sales. This seems very time consuming to
many people, but it really isn't. In the summer, I usually
spend three to four hours every two weeks going to garage
sales. That may seem like a lot, but if you compare that to
how much time the average person spends shopping at the mall,
it really isn't any longer.

Example #2: MEALS - I usually average an hour and a half each
day preparing and cleaning up from meals. Compare that to
going out to eat: It takes the typical person 20 minutes to
drive to the restaurant and 20 minutes to return home. Then
you spend 15-20 minutes ordering and waiting for your order.
You are now up to one hour. If you plan an hour for eating,
you are up to two hours total. Don't forget the two to three
hours you had to work to pay for it! This is based on an
income of $30,000 per year and a $40 family meal.

If you go to fast food restaurants instead, you could cut your
time down to 40-50 minutes and one to two hours working to pay
for it.

If you stay home and cook, it will cost you 15-30 minutes
preparing the meal and less than $5 paying for it. I'm not
saying that you should never eat out, but if you do it
regularly, it will cost you a lot more (in time and money). Is
it really worth it?

Example #3: BUYING A CAR - If you buy a new car with $500 a
month payment for five years, you pay $30,000. Let's say you
earn $30,000 per year at your job. If you assume 25% income
tax, you must earn $40,000 to pay for your $30,000 car. This
means that you have to work one year and four months for no
other reason but to pay for that car. Is it really worth
working over one year just to pay for a new car? If you
decided to buy a $7500 car instead, you could afford to take a
vacation from work for a year. Haven't you been saying you
need more free time? If you didn't get that, get out your
calculator and do the math. This is important.

Always consider the hidden costs. Would you feel more inclined
to buy a security system for that $30,000 car? How much will
that cost? Are the parts more expensive for the $30,000 car
when it breaks down? Trust me, your new car will still break
down almost as much as a used car. Ask my brother...

Be very careful when you start saying things like "Doesn't it
take too much time to be frugal?" or "I can't seem to find
time to be with my husband or children" or "I don't know where
to start saving." Often, those are excuses that you have
created to ease your guilt. If you think about it and do the
math, living simply will give you more free time. If you'd
rather not, you can always keep spending money and wishing you
had more family time. It's your choice! But take heart. If you
have read this far, then you get and A+ for taking the first
step and trying!

Money and Preschoolers
by Misty Weaver-Ostinato
Involve future investors

Your child is open to learning at this age so you should take
advantage of this and begin introducing them to money and all
its uses. Your child loves exploring their environment and
being creative, so activities that include touching and
drawing will help them enjoy money concepts. Here are a few
fun activities you can incorporate into your day that include
money. Learning about money can be fun!

*  Show your child pictures of different types of coins and
bills. Help her count out five pennies and show her how it
equals one nickel. Do the same with dimes, quarters and
dollars.

*  Draw different coins together. Trace the outlines and rub a
pencil over a sheet of paper on top of the coin.

*  Let your child hold money and keep it in his/her pocket or
little change purse. Later she can use her money to buy
something from the store.

*  Set up a play store with toy cash register and a counter
full of items to sell that you took from your child's toys.
Help her write the prices of the items on a sticker and place
on the toy. A garage sale is an excellent way to get a child
involved in the process of selling. Your child can help write
prices on items that she wants to sell and then help you give
change.

*  Give your child an allowance each week for extra activities
you had her do.

*  Show her how much things she uses or wants cost when out
shopping.

*  Set up a piggy-bank shelf with four clear jars. Each should
be labeled with the purpose of the money in that jar. Name
them the four uses of money: Spend, Save, Invest and Charity.
Then, teach them about each use.

Teaching your children about money and how to use it will help
them gain a sense of independence and also help them see that
they can't have everything they want. Giving to charity will
also help them appreciate what they have more and how they can
help other people who don't have as much as they do.

Potent Peroxide
by Janean Nusz
A wonder worker

H2O2 is the chemical equation for hydrogen peroxide, which is
a naturally occurring substance that takes its form as a
water-like substance. You are probably very familiar with the
3% hydrogen peroxide solution commonly found in pharmacies,
and may even have a bottle or two of this inexpensive elixir
in your medicine cabinet right now. Hydrogen peroxide is one
of the most powerful oxidizing substances known to man. What
does that mean to you?

As an oxidizer, hydrogen peroxide has the power to kill fungi,
bacteria and viruses - even strong concentrations of
Salmonella, Shigella and E.Coli! You probably already knew of
its germicidal properties from the many times you've used it
to treat minor wounds. But, did you know that just by
substituting hydrogen peroxide for your regular cleaner you
could make your house a cleaner, safer place to live? At about
50 cents per bottle, you can't beat peroxide for value! When
compared to those expensive cleaners that cost between $2 and
$5, you'll soon realize that this commonly overlooked
substance deserves a second glance!

Here are just a few more uses for hydrogen peroxide, some of
which may surprise you!

* Do you want to serve your family clean, bacteria free
vegetables, but are hesitant about buying those expensive
packaged vegetable washes? Simply fill a clean spray bottle
with hydrogen peroxide, and another spray bottle with common
cider vinegar. Spritz vegetables with the peroxide, then the
vinegar, or vice versa. It does not matter which you use
first, as long as you use both, one right after the other.
Rinse vegetables well under running water, then prepare and
serve as usual. No lingering taste of either the peroxide or
the vinegar will remain, and there is no need to worry about a
small amount of either liquid remaining on vegetables, as both
are natural substances and small amounts will not harm
children or adults if ingested.

* Do you need a clean, disinfected house, but worry about
using harsh, expensive chemicals in your household because you
have small children or elderly family members? Break out your
set of hydrogen peroxide and vinegar-filled spray bottles, and
start cleaning! Spray surfaces with both substances, and wipe
with a clean water-dampened cloth to wash away bacteria,
viruses, fungi, toxins, Salmonella, Shigella, E. Coli and even
yeast deposits! Be sure to use both sprays, as the dual action
is 10 times more effective that using either one alone. In
studies, these two sprays used in a combined effort to
sanitize heavily contaminated surfaces worked more effectively
than chlorine bleach or any other commercial kitchen cleaner!
Who says you have to pay more to get quality?

* Are you tired of paying for those expensive mouthwash
products, but worried about periodontal disease and bad
breath? Using hydrogen peroxide as an inexpensive gargle and
mouthwash can help prevent gum disease and kill germs that
cause bad breath! It has even been shown to help clear up
periodontal disease that may already have taken hold in your
mouth. Using this inexpensive product can save you hundreds in
dental bills by helping your family avoid frequent visits to
the dentist and even expensive surgeries! As an added bonus,
using 3% hydrogen peroxide in this manner can also help to
whiten teeth.

* Do you need a replacement for your regular toothpaste? If
so, mix baking soda with enough 3% hydrogen peroxide to form a
paste, and use this mixture instead of your regular
toothpaste. Hydrogen peroxide can also be used alone to brush
teeth. In addition, you can have family members soak their
toothbrushes in hydrogen peroxide to help kill germs and stop
the spread of illnesses to other family members.

* Replace your normal facial astringent with hydrogen peroxide
to help clear up some cases of acne.

* A solution of 1 ounce 3% hydrogen peroxide combined with 1
quart of water can be used to water plants in order to
increase health. When used in this manner, it is always a good
idea to use a small amount first to test plant sensitivity.
It is also a good idea to mix the peroxide into the water,
instead of mixing the water into the peroxide.

* How can hydrogen peroxide save the life of your household
pet? If your pet has accidentally ingested a poisonous
substance, such as antifreeze, pills or poisonous plants, use
a solution of equal parts 3% hydrogen peroxide and water to
cause vomiting. Do not try to dump this mixture down your
pet's throat, as that you may inadvertently cause a case of
inhalation pneumonia, but rather pull your pet's lower lip
away from gums to form a small pouch and place the solution
there. Use at least one tablespoon of the hydrogen
peroxide/water mixture for every ten pounds of your pet's body
weight. It may take up to two minutes for your pet to vomit
after this mixture is used. Hydrogen peroxide is often the
best solution in a case such as this, as oxygen and water are
both harmless to your dog; syrup of ipecac should not be used,
as it can be toxic to your pet.  Be sure that your pet
receives prompt professional follow-up care after poisoning
has occurred.

* And, as always, 3% hydrogen peroxide can be used to treat
minor wounds in place of expensive commercial products used
for the same purpose. Why buy expensive products when hydrogen
peroxide can take care of so many of your household needs? Add
up the savings, compare that cheap 50 cent bottle of 3%
hydrogen peroxide with those expensive cleaners, with that
high-priced bottle of mouthwash sitting in your medicine
cupboard, and with that expensive facial astringent by the
bathroom sink. Sure, they may have better flavor, or smell
better, but why add unneeded expenses to your budget when you
don't really have to? Turn to hydrogen peroxide instead!

It is important to remember that though hydrogen peroxide is a
naturally occurring substance, ingesting large quantities of
it is not recommended.

That's Outrageous!
Best Buy Return Tricks
contributed by Christine in Sugar Hill, Ga.

My husband bought a TV from Best Buy several months ago. The
salesperson told us it would fit in the cabinet (which we
bought from them the same day) and it did not even come close.
So we brought it back. They were running a promotion that gave
you a $50 gift card with each purchase over $399. We just
assumed they cancelled everything out when we made the return.

Two months later, they called to ask us if we were ever given
a card. I explained that we did not have the card because we
returned everything.

That very next month, we received a bill from them charging us
for the card plus a late charge of $25. They explained that
the card would not have been returnable and should have been
paid for when the TV was returned. I told them to use the gift
card to pay the balance and be done with it. They said that I
couldn't use a gift card to pay credit card charges. So now,
we have paid $75 for a gift card that we don't even have.

One thing is certain! I am never going to purchase anything
from them again.

                         Bottoms Up!

Instead of using expensive baby creams for diaper rash and
irritation on your baby's bottom, simply use unscented
petroleum jelly (Vaseline). My pediatrician recommended this
as an inexpensive alternative. It wipes off very easily and
moisturizes the skin. Also, it is a barrier to wetness and is
very cheap, especially if you buy a store brand. It heals the
skin just as quickly as the expensive, sticky, and hard-to-
wipe-off brands of baby diaper cream.

                          *********
                         Out of Reach

My family used to go through a roll of paper towels in a day
and a half. This habit was costing us $2 every three days.
Now, I keep the paper towels under the cabinet and I hang a
kitchen towel over the paper towel holder in my kitchen. This
way we can dry our hands and wipe up water from the counter
thus saving my paper towels for messy clean ups. This really
saves money.
