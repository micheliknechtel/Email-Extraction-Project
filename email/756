We need your help!
Jupiter Research is launching a search for the leading 
products and technologies that will enable the vision 
of Digital Ubiquity. Ideally, these will be brand new 
products or technologies, not previously announced. 
Products that have shipped prior to 2003 will not be 
a primary focus but will be considered. Our search 
will be part of our ongoing research agenda and will 
culminate with the final session at allNetDevices 
Conference & Expo, The Digital Ubiquity Forum on 
February 10th and 11th in San Jose where vendors will 
present the most innovative and exciting products and 
technologies in the "Future is Now" session. 

We are looking for technologies in categories such as 
Digital Entertainment, Mobile and Handheld Computing, 
Wireless Technologies and Devices and Personal, Local 
and Wide Area Networking. We invite submissions from 
interested vendors who wish to have their product 
showcased at the "Future is Now" Session. 

Interested parties should submit submissions to 
mgartenberg@jupitermedia.com with the following 
information: 

*  Company name 
*  Product/technology name 
*  Type of product/technology 
*  Description 
*  Why will this product or technology make digital 
   ubiquity a reality? 
*  Has this product/technology been announced or will 
   it be announced at the Forum? 
*  Is the product currently shipping? 

There is no fee to participate but participating vendors 
should plan on attending allNetdevices Conference & Expo.
