BE YOUR OWN BOSS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get out of your comfort zone, and move on to success. If you have
already developed a pattern that is generating a certain amount of
income each month, you're going to have to break that pattern to 
move to the next level. Human beings have a tendency to live with
very predictable patterns of behavior and that is why you are very
likely to keep creating a life that closely resembles the one you 
already have. If you have decided that you want and deserve more, 
it's time to do something unfamiliar, and perhaps and even a bit
uncomfortable, in order to get there. It's time to find a way to 
break free and create a new path to lead you to success. Remember
back to when you when you stated working for yourself? Was that a
stress free period in your life? Certainly not I'd wager to say. 
Don't be afraid to put yourself in that same type of uncomfortable
situation again! You've already taken the plunge once, the next 
one you take should be even easier. Prove to yourself that you are
strong enough as the boss to put yourself out there!

Marketing From The Inside Out
by John Colanzi

The "Magic Bullet" seems to be what so many marketers are
looking for. They want a secret technique or method to
guarantee their success.

I'll let you in on a secret. They're looking in the wrong
direction.

True success and prosperity start on the inside. It comes
from within yourself, not from some magical technique or
method.

There are no sure fire tools. There is no guaranteed
money making program. There is only your patience, 
persistence and most of all your mind set.

Lasting success begins in your head and radiates from your
inner core. 

Once you've developed an attitude of abundance, no one 
can take it from you.

You'll see opportunity at every turn. You'll realize that
setbacks are really lessons to be learned on the road to
freedom.

Once you know with all your being that you can succeed,
you'll realize that your success depends on you.

There are no gurus to blame.

There are no programs to blame.

There are no methods to blame.

The buck stops with you.

You are the master of your fate.

You determine what works for you.

Don't give away that power.

Learn everything you can about your business and how to
promote it, but make the final decision on how to
succeed yours.

Realize that every step you make along the road to
financial freedom is profitable either in terms of money
earned or experience learned.

If you take two steps forward and one step back, you're
still further along than if you did nothing.

Get your head right and success will come.

Stop looking outside yourself for success. Start marketing
from the inside out.

Wishing You Success,
John Colanzi

DOWNLOAD OF INTEREST
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Flash is quickly gaining popularity on the Internet and you need 
to have the latest version. On a daily basis you are probably in
contact with Flash if you browse more than a handful of websites.
The latest Flash player will make your online viewing experience 
a much faster, and less crash-prone one. The Flash player is one
of the many plug-ins that has been free for a number of years but
is one of the few that has truly stood the test of time. Head on
to http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashplayer/ and you will
see a small download link in the middle of the page. Simply put
your mouse over that link, give it a click, and the installation
process will begin. You may already have the latest version on 
your computer, and if you do, that's great. If you don't have the
latest version, the installation process will upgrade you right
away. Flash is something you will see, there is no question about
that. There is simply no reason not to have the player that will
let you see Flash the way is was meant to be viewed.
