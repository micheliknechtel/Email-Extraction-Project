Dear Book Club Reader:
 
A young man discovers the blues. A troubled teenager searches for truth.  A
teacher comes to terms with his identity. The women of Bad Girl Creek face
the future. Self-discovery remains one of the most compelling themes in
literature, and it's threaded through this month's fiction...and one
riveting, revealing biography.
 
*   *   *
A young man growing up amid the apple orchards of 1950s Michigan discovers
two true loves in one fateful autumn: In the fall of his junior year, Martin
Dijksterhuis falls for the daughter of the foreman of his family's orchard,
and he falls hard for the blues. As a young man sets out to find his voice
and answer his calling, and the journey thus begun is the heart of Robert
Hellenga's gorgeous BLUES LESSONS. This elegiac, stunningly etched novel has
won wide acclaim, and it's just out in paperback.

climactic changes for troubled teenager Josie, her desperately cheerful
mother, her weather-obsessed uncle, and LA emigrant Rolando, whose wrath
threatens to rain upon them all. An engaging, mysterious novel.
