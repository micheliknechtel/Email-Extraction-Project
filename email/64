                         New Habits

I have several habits that I would like to change, but it
always seems that I'll never accomplish these goals. This
year, I decided to do something different. I wrote down
several of my goals on individual notecards. I also included
on each the amount of time I would like to focus on that
particular goal. I was so excited as I shuffled the cards and
randomly chose one. I will work on this goal for four weeks.
As this goal becomes a habit, I will draw another card and
begin working on a new goal. I'm also keeping track of my
progress on a calendar. I'm really enjoying the feeling of
accomplishment as I tackle one goal at a time.

                      Uses for Baby Oil

Here are a few great uses for Baby Oil:

*  Use for a massage (for you, partner or baby).

*  Use as a lip gloss on dry lips. It also makes lips nice and
shiny. You can also apply it on top of your matte lipstick to
give it a nice glossy look!

*  Rub on after bath or shower when skin is still damp. This
seems to rehydrate the skin much better than lotion and gives
you a nice silky look and feel!

*  Use 1 TBSP in your bath instead of using expensive bath
oil.

*  Use as a makeup remover.

*  Use after bathing in the sun to soothe your skin (the aloe
vera vitamin E baby oil is good for this).

               Affordable Healthy Ground Beef

Often, eating healthy and being frugal contradict each other
in the food department. I don't think that meat fat is
healthy, so I only buy the leanest ground beef. To keep it
frugal, I wait until round steak or a lean roast is on sale
for $1.49 per pound (or less). Then, I take it to the butcher
and ask him to grind it for me. This gives me tender meat at a
price that I can live with. The grinding is free. Please
remember that you can use less in recipes since you don't have
to allow for the fat cooking out of it.

                  More Garage Storage Space

This week I was trying to clean my garage. I decided to build
a shed onto the side of my garage. The cost of the build-it-
yourself project was going to be about $300. Not a bad price
for a 7'x12' shed. I didn't have the $300 at the time, but I
wanted to clean the garage NOW.

I ended up buying $30 worth of wood (4 2x4s and an 8x4 piece
of chip-board). Then, I built a small upstairs or a large
shelf (depending on how you want to look at it) in my garage.

Granted, it's only 4'x8' (and 3' tall), but I was able to put
my wheel barrow, my lawn mower, and several of my kid's toys
on this new shelf. I can walk under it comfortably, and I use
a piece of rope through an eye bold to lift things to the
shelf. It is a great space maker!

                    Dinner Exchange Plus

An exchange <http://www.stretcher.com/stories/02/02dec30g.cfm>
doesn't have to be a meal for a meal. A friend of mine wanted
piano lessons for her son. She asked me if I would be willing
to barter something like lessons for house cleaning. I wasn't
real keen on house cleaning, but I asked her if she liked to
cook. It turns out that she does like to cook. So, each week
that she brings her son to the lesson, she also brings a meal
plus a menu for the next meal. This way we always get
something that we like rather than just having to take
whatever is prepared.

She did this for several people in exchange for various
services.
