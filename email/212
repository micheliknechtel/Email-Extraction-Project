Fantasy Baseball Headquarters Newsletter
Spring Training 2003

It's Time for Pitchers and Catchers!  Finally!

This week, the Fantasy Baseball Headquarters introduced our first team 
previews.  We list the studs, dogs and kids for all 30 Major League 
teams.  This is a must read before heading to Draft Day 2003.  Our team 
previews can be found at http://www.letsplay2.com/baseball/team_previews.cfm

With even more sites going to a pay service, the Fantasy Baseball 
Headquarters is proud to offer the vast majority of our services completely 
free of charge.  Customized dollar values, player profiles, stat downloads 
and a host of other features are all available at the Fantasy Baseball 
Headquarters 365 days a year at the low low cost of $0.00.

Speaking of dollar values, our 2003 values are primed and ready to go!  Use 
our dollar value calculator to customize the dollar values for your 
league.  It's all available at 
http://www.letsplay2.com/baseball/dollar_parms.cfm  These dollar values 
will be updated as Opening Day approaches based on any news that comes out 
of camps in Florida and Arizona.

While most of the services at the Fantasy Baseball Headquarters are 
completely free, we do have a couple of pay services you may be interested 
in (after all, we would like to make money, too).

Our Commish Services is an unbiased service that provides a neutral, expert 
party to be the arbitrator of all questionable transactions in your league. 
With a combination of statistical analysis, projections, and opinions drawn 
from combined decades of fantasy baseball experience, the Commish Services 
provides a timely solution to ensure fairness in any dealings within your 
league.  Get all of the details here: 
http://www.letsplay2.com/baseball/commish_intro.cfm

If you don't have time to surf the net every day to get the latest player 
news, let our service send all of the news right to your e-mail box every 
day.  For only 99 cents a month, it's a very affordable service that makes 
your life a lot more convenient.  Go to 
http://www.letsplay2.com/baseball/email/index.cfm to register today.
