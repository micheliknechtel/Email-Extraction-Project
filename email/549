"One of the best novels on Deep Space Nine isn't a novel at all," writes
Cinescape. That's because THE LIVES OF DAX is a thrilling collection of DS9
short stories about one of the most intriguing characters ever to emerge
from the Trek universe. The many lives of the immortal alien, who carries
memories of lifetimes from humanoid to humanoid, are chronicled by fave
authors like Steven Barnes, Michael Jan Friedman, L.A. Graf, Jeffrey Lang,
S.D. Perry, Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, Kristine Kathryn Rusch,
Robert Simpson, and Susan Wright, and edited by Marco Palmieri.
