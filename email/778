NEW YORK - The Times Square ball may have dropped, but many people are still

photographs.  There's a picture of Kreskin with George Kirby, but no one=20

Subject: History Channel UFOs show:

Hi,
We finally have an airdate for "UFO Hot Spots" (I believe that's the only
one you were involved in). It will air on 1/29 at 9:00 PM Eastern &
Pacific on the History Channel. FYI, the other two shows in the
series "UFOs in the Bible" and "When UFOs Arrive" will air on
1/28 at 9:00 PM and 1/30 at 9:00 PM respectively.
