                      February  -  Grade 11
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Juniors -- The ACT is given this month, so stay at least as sharp as
your pencils. Some students prefer the content and format of the ACT
to that of the SAT I. Look at both tests in a practice book or on a
computer program and decide which is a better way for you to
demonstrate your capabilities. You can also take some sample tests
to see which format is more comfortable for you.

Now is the time to prepare serously for the next SAT I. Once called
the Scholastic Aptitude Tests, the SAT I was generally regarded as a
measure of innate ability for which it was impossible to study.
Reborn and re-centered as the Scholastic Assessment Test, it now
assesses what you have learned and what you can do with your
knowledge. Even the Educational Testing Service agrees that you can
successfully prepare for both the SAT I and II. Of course, numbers
don't tell your whole story to admission officers, but some schools
still use cutoffs in their admissions process. Maximize your
options. Start thinking about schools to visit during spring
vacation. If you plan to display spring sports skills to college
athletic departments, now is the time to set up video dates and
visits.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
                      February  -  Grade 12
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Seniors -- Don't succumb to senioritis before you complete all the
details of your college applications. Finalize all your February 1
or February 15 deadlines. Make sure that your guidance office is
ready to send mid-year reports, and check yours for accuracy before
they are forwarded to the colleges. Remember, a quirk of the
keyboard can turn an "A" in AP Physics into a "D-" in Beginners'
Cooking. Ouch! Don't get burnt! If you have new accomplishments or
honors, inform your schools. Even if you have already been accepted
to the college of your choice through early decision, early action,
or rolling admissions, keep your grades in the "acceptable" range.
College admissions are always contingent upon the successful
completion of your senior year, and the word "successful" is
interpreted totally at the discretion of each school's admission
officers. You may think you can sail along with all "C"s, but they
may decide to put you out to sea. Consistent, independent motivation
is the mark of a successful college student - even before matriculation.

Those of you who are still waiting to hear from colleges would
probably enjoy a few kind words from friends and family. In the
meantime, though, Happy Valentine's Day from EDUFAX!
