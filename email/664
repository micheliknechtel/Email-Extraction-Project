Fellow Logophiles,

Good morning. Many of you had opinions on the list that I 
presented you with. I would say that slightly more of you 
think it is a valid endeavor than think it is muck...but it 
was pretty close! Some of you even added your own picks 
to the list. So now I want to know, what words or phrases 
would you want to see go on Lake Superior State University's 
28th annual 'extreme' List of Words Banished from the Queen's 
English for Mis-Use, Over-Use and General Uselessness? Let's 
make our own list! Reflect on it for a moment...now email 
them to me and I will present the list later this week. On 
with today's issue!

Sincerely,
Shannon

WORD:  fealty  \FEE-uhl-tee\  (noun)
: Fidelity to one's lord; the feudal obligation by which the 
tenant or vassal was bound to be faithful to his lord.
: The oath by which this obligation was assumed.
: Fidelity; allegiance; faithfulness. 

WORD WISE: Fealty comes from Old French fealté, from Latin 
fidelitas, "fidelity," from fidelis, "faithful," from fides, 
"faith," from fidere, "to trust."

QUOTE: Barbour believed Christian conservatives represented 
a critical constituency, and he looked for opportunities to 
display his fealty to them.
