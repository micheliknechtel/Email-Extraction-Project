1. Two More Hybrids Certified For Clean Fuel Deduction

The IRS has certified two more hybrid gas-electric automobiles as being
eligible for the clean-burning fuel deduction.  Purchasers of a new Honda
Insight for model years 2000, 2001 and 2002 and purchasers of a Honda
Civic Hybrid for model year 2003 will be able to claim a deduction of
$2,000 for the year that the vehicle was first put into use.  Get the
details at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/ir-02-97.pdf


2. New Designated Private Delivery Services (PDSs)

Two new PDSs, FedEx International Priority and FedEx International First,
will provide delivery services to the United States from foreign
countries.  For the complete list of designated PDSs, rules for
determining the postmark date for filing returns timely, and information
about applying to become a PDS, go to IRS Notice 2002-62 at
