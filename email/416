This week the big news is Apple's new Safari browser. Based on the
KDE project, this fast new browser promises extensive standards
support and fast JavaScript execution.  Speaking of speed...

I'm happy to announce that I've written a book, titled "Speed Up
Your Site: Web Site Optimization" from New Riders. It shows you
how to shrink and streamline your site for maximum display speed
and minimum bandwidth costs. The book shows you how to optimize
and compress popular web page components, including JavaScript.
And of course, we've got excerpts.

WebReference just launched a series of exclusive excerpts from
my book, starting with Chapter 10, "Optimizing JavaScript for
Execution Speed." Thanks to all of you in the JavaScript community
who answered my questions for the two JavaScript chapters. Enjoy.

4. ELSEWHERE: W3C releases scripting standard, caveat,
               Safari's Open Source JavaScriptCore,
               AllWebMenus

* W3C releases scripting standard, caveat

The W3C released its DOM Level 2 recommendation for using scripts
in web pages this week, but urged authors to use scripting in
moderation.
http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-HTML/
http://news.com.com/2100-1023-979976.html
News.com, Jan. 9, 2003

* Safari's Open Source JavaScriptCore

Apple's new Safari browser adapts the KDE project code to the Mac
OS 10.X. Their JavaScriptCore framework combines the KJS library
with the PCRE regular expression library, which allows easier
extensibility. Apple chose KDE for its small size (140K lines of
code), efficient execution, and clean code. Apple is giving back
to the open source community at their webcore site.

While JavaScript execution is fast, early reports from beta
testers show low frame rates for Flash ActionScript movies.
The developers say they've fixed the problem.
