* My Excellent Digital Photo Adventure  

I'm just back from the Galapagos Islands. If you'd seen me there, you 
would have instantly recognized me. I was the perfect geek: digital 
cameras were draped from both shoulders, a pair of binoculars hung 
from my neck, and I wore a T-shirt advertising a software company. I 
came back with 300 digital images. This week I'm going to tell you 
what I learned about digital photography.  

Before I start, you might want to take a look at what I said last 
spring in two newsletters: "Want to Take Digital Pix? Read This 
First," where I talk about how to tackle managing a big bunch of 
photos; and "More on Taking Digital Pix," where I tell you how to 
display the pix.  

"Want to Take Digital Pix? Read This First" is at:  
http://www.pcworld.com/howto/article/0,aid,98624,tk,sbx,00.asp  

You can find "More on Taking Digital Pix" at:  
http://www.pcworld.com/howto/article/0,aid,98644,tk,sbx,00.asp  

A Dream Machine  

I got lucky. The Nikon rep must have been in a fog--he agreed to let 
me use the company's $1730 D100 digital camera while on vacation. 
Yeah, I know it's pricey. Hell, it's crazy expensive; I swear that my 
heart stopped when the rep said yes. But the D100 is a sweet camera; 
for lots of reasons, it's worth the bucks. It's a single lens reflex 
camera, designed just like a 35-millimeter film camera. That means 
it's WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), with a depth-of-field 
preview button that's standard on most SLRs, and I can use any Nikon 
lens with it. The settings are a professional photographer's dream: 
Among the zillions I could mention are white balance correction, white 
balance and flash bracketing, hue correction, and a super autofocus 
system. The Nikon uses a memory buffer for fast writes of about 3 to 5 
seconds in uncompressed mode. And its battery life is stunning: I used 
one lithium-ion battery for the entire seven days.  

There's more: Remember when you loaded your print camera with slow 
film for outdoors, say, ASA 64 (i"ISO" in digital photography), then 
walked into a low-light situation? You had to either change the film 
in mid-roll or suffer through under- or overexposed shots. The Nikon 
let me change the digital film speed from ISO 200 to 6400 on the fly. 
Very cool.   

I suspect that "white balance" and "ISO" aren't terms many of you give 
much thought to when shooting digital pix. Well, maybe you should. My 
buddy Dave Johnson's "Digital Focus" newsletter is a remarkable piece 
of work--if you're not reading it, you're missing out. For instance, 
in Dave's "Shoot in Tricky Light Conditions," he takes some of the 
mystery out of both white balance and digital film speeds. Read it at:  
http://www.pcworld.com/howto/article/0,aid,73204,tk,sbx,00.asp  

Then subscribe to Dave's newsletter at:  
http://www.pcworld.com/resource/newsletters/index.asp?sub_source=PCW_XD  

Okay, so I've said this before. It's worth repeating: Even though the 
Nikon's expensive, I think it's worth every cent. I've got to return 
the camera, but I plan to wait six months or so until the price drops, 
then buy one.

My Photo Lesson  

Something critical I learned about shooting with the Nikon is to use 
the camera's RAW format. A RAW shot is unprocessed--it reads exactly 
what the camera's sensor sees, with no conversion or formatting. If 
you use even the highest JPEG setting, the camera compresses images 
and there's some loss of color, sharpness, and details. Think of RAW 
files as digital negatives; shooting in RAW format lets you use the 
camera's software to modify photos on your PC, giving you tremendous 
flexibility in image modification. Unfortunately, RAW isn't 
standardized yet and only a handful of cameras use this high-quality 
format.  

If you decide to take digital photography seriously, you'll likely end 
up buying a high-end digital SLR that uses RAW files. Do that and 
you'll need Bibble, a $99 program that dramatically enhances your 
ability to manipulate RAW files. Among other things, Bibble lets you 
quickly browse RAW files, modify white balance, change exposure, and 
save images in a variety of formats, including TIFF and JPEG. Bibble 
works with the Nikon D1/X/H, Canon D30, Kodak 720x/760, Olympus 
E10/E20, and Fuji S2Pro. The program is essential if you're going to 
shoot lots of images in RAW format. It's available from Bibble Labs:

Tour the Galapagos  

Some of you may be intrigued by the Galapagos Islands. You can learn 
lots more about them from Public Broadcasting's "Voyage of the 
Odyssey" program. For an overview and background information, go to:

Snap This, Willya?  

Once you get your digital camera, snap a copy of this newsletter and 
send it to a couple of buddies. Then insinuate that if they don't sign 
up for their own copy, you'll make 'em sit through all your holiday 
pictures. To avoid this fate, they'll need to go to:

One more thing: If you're a recent reader of these Home Office
