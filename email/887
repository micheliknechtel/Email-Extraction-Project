Positive Signs for the Ad Industry
By Robyn Greenspan
 
It may be small, but at least it's a positive figure for the struggling 
advertising industry where a report from Global Insight, Inc. (http://www.
globalinsight.com) finds that the U.S. ad market should experience a 6 percent 
increase in 2003. Driven by corporate profits, retail sales, and consumer 
disposable income, the advertising industry could be poised for successive years
of growth, peaking in 2003, and then declining slightly every year through 2006
. 
 
Global Insight predicts that the largest growth through 2006 will come from 
radio, cable and the Internet, and the industries spending the most money, in 
terms of growth, through 2006 are: entertainment; wholesale and industrial 
suppliers; security and commodity brokers; insurance carriers and agents; and 
business services companies. 
 
Jupiter Research (http://www.jupiterresearch.com/) (a unit of this site's 
corporate parent) is equally optimistic, particularly in the online advertising 
segment. Jupiter expects the industry to earn $6.2 billion in 2003  --  up from 
$5.6 billion in 2002  --  and gain momentum into 2007, where it will grow to $14
billion. 
 
Jupiter attributes much of the advertising growth to an abundance of online 
households  --  more than three-quarters of all homes by 2007 will be online  --
and increased time spent on the Internet. 
 
Even though 2002 was a disappointing year for the ad industry, a joint report 
from The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) (http://www.iab.net) and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) (http://www.pwcglobal.com/) revealed slight 
improvement  --  albeit 1 percent  --  from the third quarter over the second 
quarter. Compared to the year-over-year declines (Q3 2002 showed an 18 percent 
decline over Q3 2001, and Q2 2002 dropped almost 22 percent from Q2 2001) the 1 
percent increase seems like a hopeful indicator for 2003. 
 
"The return to positive growth in both online and offline media is a healthy 
sign for the overall advertising industry, but should be viewed cautiously, as 
we believe that the positive steps that are being taken are as much cost-driven 
as they are recovery oriented," said Tom Hyland, chair PricewaterhouseCoopers 
New Media Group. "Add to that the historically stronger performance of the 
fourth quarter, and it appears interactive advertising may end the year with two
consecutive growth quarters." 
 
Marketers are beginning to regain their confidence in online advertising as 
research from DoubleClick (http://www.doubleclick.com) finds that 51 percent 
expect a budget increase in 2003, and 57 percent plan to increase spending on e-
mail marketing.
