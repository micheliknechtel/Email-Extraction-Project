===  MODERATOR COMMENT ===

Dear HelpMates,

Well, the first thing I noticed, sitting down to do this issue, is
that I'd forgotten to order my 2003 Chase's Calendar, which is my
source for all those holidays, each day
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071390987/ref=nosimmywishlis
tA (Sheesh. Where did the time go?! I usually order it in October.)

Then, I must tell you about having breakfast with Raleigh Pinksy
yesterday morning. http://promoteyourself.com  You may remember that
last week, I was feeling so sheepish about letting her down? (I had
bought some particualarly interesting PR URLs last year that we'd
planned to develop - and I've just not had time to do it.)

Well, she's got two great projects she's working on, and has invited
me to participate. That means, I really MUST finish the book I
started in August, about the 10 businesses to start online without a
dime! (I'd better call Nancy Preiss, this week, to help compile the
rest of the book. http://campaignsthatwork.com/ so Serenata
http://serenata.nu can format the e-book. She's getting really good
at it!)

But, a lot of my time of the past couple of weeks has been spent in
total frustration with our server move.  Rob Marlbrough, Jr.
http://webwizards.net went out of his way to put a special package
together for me, to address my bizarre server needs. (Uh, aside from
my own stuff, I am hosting sites for 'partners' or friends who need
direct access to their own control panels, without giving them
access to my sites.)

His new servers, with their very interesting control panels look
like their features will be quite a timesaver - once we get all the
moves completed. In the meantime, it's been quite a headache. I am
sure that Rob is sorry he ever started this. He's spent so much time
sorting out the different needs. And mail has been lost. (So, if you
sent me anything since about mid-December and haven't heard back,
please, do resend it. Thanks.)

But dealing  with someone like Rob, despite my frustration, and
perhaps my sometimes less than kind demeanor, really is a joy. I
KNOW that I can count on him to sort it all out. I know that he has
stayed up nights to work on my sites. I know that he will do
everything he can to make me happy. (Well, not everything... Rick
might object.)

And there are little bright flashes through this adventure. Like
yesterday, when I couldn't figure out how to FTP to a site that had
just been moved to it's own server via my WS-FTP program. And I was
in a hurry, so I didn't have time to figure what I'd done wrong.
Rob's control panel has an FTP feature built-in. I noticed a little
drop-down menu on the bottom corner of the page and saw an 'edit'
function.

For some you, this is no big deal, but for me, WOW! What a treat. I
was able to click on the page I wanted and edit the code right in
the browser. I didn't do anything fancy, but I needed to fix a
problem on my appointment page
http://taxanxiety.com/appointment.html (no it's not linked anywhere
on the site - my clients get the address from a letter or my e-mails
only to them) it took me about three minutes AND to download the
revision to my computer. I really that feature. (OK, so you've been
using this for years. But, hey, small things amuse small minds. OK?)
So, Rob, if I haven't said it before - THANK YOU.

One of the other interesting things I discovered in his e-mail tool
is that I can build a custom mailing list, just by using the
'forwarding' function. It looks like I can add as many people as I
want (no doubt there is a limit) and name the list. And this is
aside from some of the other mailing list tools.

And speaking of spam...the webmail tool is really interesting. Yes,
I know, who wants to use webmail. BUT, it has spam filters I can
customise. So, I can set it to screen out entire URLs, or just the
contents of the mail. Running that before I download my mail will
screen out the junk. Then, I can download the real mail. And it's
faster than the old version.

I can hardly wait to see what else I can do.

Sorry to go on. But, I like clever features when I can see how
clearly they're going to help save my time during this coming tax
season.

And speaking of marketing. You never know how long it will take the
seeds you sow to sprout.

About 10 years ago, I started teaching classes at UCLA to help tax
pros pass the IRS exam to become Enrolled Agents.
http://taxmama.com/Articles-Pro/EA_1.htm

I got a call yesterday from one of the students in my second class,
from 9 years ago. She had retired and moved away last year. Two of
her clients refused to move on - so she called me yesterday about
referring them to me.

Frankly, with the sale of a big chunk of my tax practice, I had
really expected to have a reduced load this tax season. But, people
keep calling. I've gotten more new clients in the past month
(supposed to be a slow/dead time?) than any month all year. What's
going on????

We have a new site to review. What a coincidence, after writing all
the above, it's a webhost. And it sounds interesting. (look at her
stats program) So, please DO go and review it.

But, that brings me to just one last thing. (I know, this has gone
on waaaay too long, already.) Someone wrote to me telling me that,
try as she might, she couldn't find a link or e-mail address to
submit her site for review.

So, just a reminder, my friends. The guidelines are above, in every
issue, labeled in the table of contents via the deliberately obscure
title - SUBMISSION GUIDELINES. And the link to submit is hidden,
buried even, in each issue, where you would least expect to find it,
as the very first line in the 'SITE EVALUATIONS' section, where it
reads  'SUBMIT YOUR SITE HERE'.

===> TOPIC: Looking for better website traffic reporting software

From: Martha Retallick, Lrpdesigns
mailto:Lrpdesigns@theriver.com?CC=ihelpdesk@adventive.com&subject=Stats

What do other HelpDesk-ers recommend in the way of website traffic
reporting software, aka server logs? One of my web hosts uses
Wusage, which I like, but the other uses Analog, which I am not fond
of.

I've been taking a look at Webalizer, and, so far, like what I see.
But I am open to other suggestions.

Thank you in advance for your help, Desk <g>.

Hello Help-Desk Members,

I have been a lurker and occasional participant in this list since
1996/7, during this time I have started, designed and sold an online
store, started and continue to run a web design/services business
and have developed an increasing interest in the research and
information profession. This last year has been a trying one, partly
due to circumstances beyond my control and partly due to bad choices
(thats the worst - when you know bad times could have been
prevented! Ah the would've-s and could've-s and should've-s of
life..)

As I reflect on the last year and the years before and the year to
come it occurred to me how much this list has helped me over the
years.

I believe it was Martha Retallick who was expressing some discontent
and frustration at helping others and not receiving thank yous.
Well, she's right, it is high time a strong thank you should be
expressed to those who I've found particularly inspirational and I'm
sure there are many of you out there who will agree.

Thank you for:

William Bontrager http://www.willmaster.com

Participating so freely and becoming such a valuable resource to the
Internet community. Back in 1996 you started a community website and
in your discovery of the process and intricacies of design, education
and political mediation, I learned too.

Azriela Jaffe http://www.createyourownluck.com
Sharing your life with us all. I learn from your light, conversational
articles. You balance husband, family and a growing business, plus one
of the best newsletters out there today - 'Create Your Own Luck'.
There have been some really down times for me in the last couple of years,
your newsletter always reminds me of the luck in every situation, and
has inspired me to act when I might otherwise have simply just cried ;).

Martha Retallick http://www.lrpdesigns.com
Sharing your increasing knowledge on the web design business. Your
reviews are indepth and on-target. You've expanded your business and
grown into an expert on postcard marketing right before our eyes.
You remind me that the business marketplace is ever-changing and
success if not here already, is just around the corner.

Nancy Roebke http://www.profnet.com
Your wise advice about networking, your fight for intellectual property
rights, for educating us on how to communicate with each other and our
customers. Your articles are engaging and I always walk away a better
business person for having read them.

And of course! Thank you to Eva Rosenberg for
mediating, hosting and always being there.

What can we all learn from these leaders in our community?

Consistency, Dedication, Good Will and Optimism.......Pay Off!
They define success with their achievements and my goal next year
is to capitalize on what I've learned and do the same.

Happy New Year,

=== RESPONSES - NEW ===

===> TOPIC:  SPAM

From: Lynn <lynn@ecgincc.com>

Hi Everyone,

Happy New Year, and I hope you all had great holidays.

I received a piece of mail the other day that was very creative.
Someone forwarded a piece of mail that appeared to be a spam
complaint to me about me. From the mail:

I have received the following unsolicited e-mail from someone at
your domain or your IP range.

I do not wish to receive such messages in the future, so please take
the appropriate measures to ensure that this unsolicited e-mail is
not repeated.

I did some investigating on my own and with UU Net  Security as he
forwarded spam headers did not show anything connected to me - not
my domain, not an IP, mail server, nothing.

This is spam. It is a new trick from spammers. I would expect to see
it more in the future. It was first seen Jan 4 2003, the same day I
received it. Treat it as any other piece of spam.

If anyone want to see the original, please email and I'll be very
happy to forward it.

Hi Eva,

I know you love to hear how our friends at Verisign are doing, so
here's a news article that may interest you -- they are splitting off
the domain name business and reviving the oh-so-popular Network
Solutions brand:

http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105-979205.html

The president of the new division is called Champion Mitchell
(good start!), and he says:

"There were a lot of people who had not gotten over the monopoly
mentality. Those people are no longer with us."

They're also opening a new customer service division. We shall see ...

This Week's Site #1  http://www.reenee.net
Web Host
Please send all correspondence using this address
mailto:serena@reenee.net?CC=ihelpdesk@adventive.com&subject=Reenee


From: "Serena M. Giddens"
mailto:serena@reenee.net?CC=ihelpdesk@adventive.com&subject=Reenee

URL:  http://www.reenee.net

Reenee.net is a web hosting service, providing web services for
business and personal site owners.   My daughter, Shauna, and I
started our business on March 1, 2002, with our main goal being
to establish a good customer base and income for the years to come.

That's very important, as I will lose almost half of my current
disability income at retirement age.  I will not be able to survive
on that reduced fixed income, so I very much need to develop a
dependable source of income within the next 10 years.  The plan
is to not take any salary from the business for several years, at
least not until there is sufficient funding to meet ongoing
business expenses, growth of services, etc., funneling income
right back into the business to optimize growth and income before
the elapse of ten years.

Hopefully the business will thrive, my needs will be met, and
Shauna will have an already established business in time to come.

Fortunately, while I'm pretty much a housebound disabled person,
I can sit at the computer (I have two) on a flexible schedule
(related to physical limitations), have a background in computer-
related tech support (both in off-line businesses and for another
web host.)  In fact, my experience in tech support at that web
host later motivated me to choose web hosting as a business as I
really enjoyed working in that arena.  In addition to being a
substantial life line for me, I love all things computer-related,
including web design and providing a safe haven for the online
communities to come and play.

(I created and have maintained since 1996 a personal web site,
SERENA's WORLD (http://www.serena1.com) - a kid-safe entertainment/
activities site - which is fairly popular, especially in the
Christmas season (but really all year), and utilized by a lot of
schooldistricts, private and public schools, libraries, media rooms
and, of course, families.  In fact SERENA's WORLD received two very
generous donations in December to keep it on line through the
Christmas holidays when  it ran out of its 20-gig bandwidth
allotment for the month mid-way through December.  SW is 200+ pages,
so I am familiar with managing a large site.)


My main problem is in getting the word out about my business site
and services on a non-existent advertising budget.  But I don't want
to have a bunch of banner ads on my site in an effort to accomplish
this. I've submitted to search engines, listed my site with some
other business sites, and advertised it on my personal site (since
it gets a fair amount of traffic).  I'm also in the process of
contacting folks I used to work with in the legal community to let
them know I'm here and seeking new clients.

I worked at a large law firm in Dallas and many of those attorneys
who are familiar with my work ethic, quality and reliability of work
have left and formed their own law firms.  I'm a natural to service
law firms with my background in legal since 1966.  The law firm
from which I retired disabled plans to have me design a new web site
for them and host it - that project begins in a few weeks, and I
have a couple of other business clients already, but the business
must definitely grow to meet the ongoing expenses of maintaining my
web hosting business.

I'm still operating in the red.  I know these things take time, but
I must grow the business sufficiently within the next year to at
least offset my monthly business expenses which was and is funded
from my own fixed income and credit.

At any rate, I just received my I-HelpDesk_WebReview Digest, Issue 1155
which mentioned WebReviews, so I thought I'd submit and see what I can
learn to better equip our business for successfully meeting our goals.

Thanks for this opportunity.

Sincerely,

Serena M. Giddens
