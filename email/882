** This Week's Pick for Windows XP/Me/98: The Sleuthhound 
by iSleuthhound Technologies

Are you having trouble remembering the name of a document but can recall 
some of the words it contains? The Sleuthhound is a search tool that lets 
you find data on your hard drive, just as you would using an Internet search 
engine. It supports "exact phrase" searches and wildcards, and displays 
relevant matches with your keywords highlighted. CD-ROMs and other removable 
media can also be searched. You can also search by document date--for 
instance, using the search query "Date:2002.11*" retrieves all documents 
created in November of 2002. 

The Sleuthhound has a simple to use interface. Specifying the Search Zone 
with selected folders for search, enter the keyword and clicking "Find it" 
produces an instant keyword result and the located documents in the browser. 
Shareware version returns searches for text, HTML and MS Word documents. 
Professional version returns searches for Excel, Powerpoint, Adobe PDF, 
Wordperfect, all versions of Word, and other popular document types. DO 
advanced searches, and save your favourite searches.

** Last Week's Pick for Windows XP/NT/2000: Registry First Aid
by Rose City Software

The latest version of Registry First Aid fixes more Registry errors than 
ever before...and it's safe to use! Are you tired of having software lock up 
on your computer, taking forever to load, or even causing Windows to crash? 
The problem could very likely be incorrect Registry entries caused by 
software installations/uninstallations that went awry. Registry First Aid 
can fix these problems quickly and safely! Not all software un-installations 
do a complete job leaving behind numerous nagging file references in the 
Windows registry pointing to files that no longer exist. In time, you can 
end up with hundreds of these files that may slow down your computer and 
cause software to lock up, requiring a hard reboot of your computer.

Registry First Aid scans registry for orphan file/folder references, finds 
these files or folders on your drives that may have been moved from their 
initial locations, and then corrects your registry entries to match the 
located files or folders. In addition, if your registry has links to files 
of deleted applications, Registry First Aid will find these invalid entries 
and remove them from your registry. With Registry First Aid, your Windows 
registry will be always clean and correct, helping your programs load faster 
and speeding up your computer. Registry First Aid - Keep it clean and keep 
it fast!

** User to User Review: Image Broadway 
Reviewer: Christopher Spera

It’s January. That means those of us who have digital cameras are sitting on 
(probably) hundreds of pictures that they took over the Holidays. If you’re 
wondering what to do with yourself and 4-5 CD’s worth of digital photos, 
then check out this week’s review of Image Broadway. It’s an image editing 
tool for Win32 systems. 

Image Broadway is exceptionally sophisticated and easy-to-use. It lets you 
create or edit images with professional quality in just minutes. It is 
powerful enough for most serious graphic designers, Webmasters, and 
photographers yet simple enough for business or occasional users who just 
want to edit, tweak, or create new images and text. It has professional 
quality Rendering Tools that let you enhance buttons, logos, and images with 
perspective views, Color Corrections and Tonal Adjustments. You can analyze 
color balance, evaluate image perspective, and automatically correct and 
enhance your images.
