The country is celebrating the 100th anniversary of 
Orville and Wilbur Wright's first flight. On Dec. 17, 
1903, Orville took off from Kitty Hawk, on the Outer 
Banks of North Carolina, and stayed in the air for 12 
seconds. Then Wilbur, on the same day, flew the same 
plane for 852 feet for 59 seconds. 

What very few people know is that it didn't work out 
as well as everyone expected. Two weeks later they 
started an airline, Wright Brothers Express, which 
flew from Dayton to Akron. Two weeks after that, 
they filed for bankruptcy. 

Orville said, ``We didn't expect business to be that 
bad. People just weren't flying as much as we expected.'' 

Wilbur said, ``We offered discount fares, frequent 
flyer miles, and free coffee -- and we still had to 
go into Chapter 11. The banks wouldn't give us any 
more money.'' 

Orville said, ``In order to stay afloat, we were told 
we had to downsize our operation.'' 

``The only way to do this,'' Wilbur said, ``was to fire 
either Orville or myself. It hasn't been an easy time 
for either of us. I should have stayed because I was 
the more experienced pilot. I flew the plane 852 feet 
and Orville only flew it 120 feet.'' 

``But,'' said Orville, ``I was the first one to fly.'' 

To eliminate unneeded help, the bankruptcy judge said the 
brothers had to fire all the ground mechanics, except the 
one who turned the propellers to start the plane. 

The Wright Brothers blamed themselves for choosing the 
first commercial flight from Dayton to Akron. Orville 
said, ``No one in Dayton wanted to go to Akron, and no 
one in Akron wanted to go to Dayton, so we offered flights 
from Dayton to Cleveland.'' 

Wilbur said, ``It didn't get us out of the red, so we 
asked the government to bail us out. We argued that if 
it didn't come to our rescue, there would never be 
commercial aviation.''

Orville said, ``The government turned us down on the 
grounds that if flying ever caught on, many airlines 
would go bankrupt.'' 

Wilbur added, ``When we were turned down by the feds,
Wright Brothers stock plummeted.'' 

Orville agreed, ``Wall Street stopped believing in us.
The only thing we still had was our bicycle business.'' 

Wilbur said, ``That is what we were originally noted for.'' 

In spite of all the setbacks, the Wright brothers continued 
running their airline with one, then two, and then three 
planes -- all made of muslin and plywood. They flew to 
Muncie, Ind., Paducah, Ky., and Ann Arbor, Mich. The name 
Wright Brothers Express never caught on so they decided to 
change it to United Airlines because it had more sex 
appeal to it, at least until it went broke.
