Are you a word wiz?
  Where do you think the term "crocodile tears," meaning 
"pretended sorrow," comes from?

  A. From a misinterpretation of a Greek word meaning "fear of 
lizards."
  B. From an incident involving the crocodile in J. M. Barrie's 
_Peter Pan_.
  C. From an old story about crocodiles crying while eating 
their prey.
  D. From the false concern of a tyrant nicknamed "The 
Crocodile."

Answer:
  No need to cry if you picked answer C! How did crocodiles 
come to be known for pretended tears? An ancient fable tells 
of the crocodile's habit of crying while eating its prey. Of 
course, a crocodile is not really sorry for killing and eating 
another animal because that's how it survives. So when someone 
is said to shed "crocodile tears," it refers to a show of 
pretended sorrow usually by someone who has done something 
cruel.
