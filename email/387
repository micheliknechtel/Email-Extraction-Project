``Much of what passes for observing the holidays is 
utilitarian, a specific and refined form of busywork: 
required parties, duty gifts, corporate Christmas cards.
More that somehow adds up to less. ... The static in the 
collective psyche that threatens to drown out the small 
voices of cosmic questioning or contentment is so loud 
... that it's a miracle everyone doesn't go deaf.'' So 
writes Anna Quindlen under the headline ``Begone, Buzz! 
Be Still, Soul'' in Newsweek. 

Another of my favorites, Parade's mental giant Marilyn 
Vos Savant, rings the same note in her quote about 
trends for the New Year. ``The biggest and scariest 
trend I see is more and more stimulation in our culture. 
Lights, camera, action -- everybody all the time.'' 


DOES THIS MEAN that 2003 might be the year we say 
bye-bye to buzz? I doubt it. Last year ended on a 
veritable orgy of hype, PR, push and promo about a 
sudden clutch of surprisingly good new movies. Newsweek 
carried that on with its cover story of our entering 
the ``anime'' era with virtual cinematography sequels 
to ``The Matrix.'' Though one can still hope for less 
hustle, bustle and hype, it's hard to fault the one 
industry in a recession-bust New Year that is going 
great guns -- entertainment! 


I RETURNED to New York after a week in Palm Beach, 
Fla., at the old-world Breakers Hotel, a family-friendly, 
yet still glamorous, kind of place. Maybe lying in the 
sun by the ``Mediterranean'' pool watching the children 
of the well-to-do cavort softened my brain. It's a cinch 
nobody in Palm Beach worries too much in the manner of us 
New Yorkers. I envy them that; I tried to have a week of 
their kind of dolce far niente, just in case this new year  
turns out to be an annus horribilus. 

It was funny to have a golfer tell me that when he hit 
the links of the Breakers' fabulous new Ocean Course at 
8 a.m. Jan. 1, he met a foursome coming off the 18th 
green. These men had most likely begun playing when it 
was still dark, and every one of them was wearing a 
tuxedo and carrying their own golf clubs. Did they go 
from the gala to the first tee? I guess so. It was the 
kind of zany F. Scott Fitzgerald moment Americans used 
to cherish before we learned there was someone called 
Osama bin Laden. 

Speaking of him, let me return to my theme. On Feb. 
2, I'll have a birthday, along with such famous souls 
as Barry Diller, Elaine Stritch, Farrah Fawcett, 
Christie Brinkley, Tom Smothers and Loren Dunlap. 
But they'll all let it roll off their backs. I, on 
the other hand, will be an astounding 80 years old. 
Since I never intended to be 80 and made no plans, 
I'd like to turn this unlikely event into something 
special. 

So let me ask. Have you ever enjoyed something in this 
column, found it worthwhile, entertaining, useful? Then,
if you'd like to send me a birthday gift, let me suggest 
the one that would matter. The city of New York, and 
thus the nation it represents, were victims of the 
events of 9/11. So again, it would be wonderful if 
you could write a check to the PPI (No. 501C). (This 
is the mayor's Public Private Initiative tax-deductible 
arm for giving a gift to the city. You could also use 
this info in case you want to leave New York City a 
bequest in your will.) 

You can mail this gift to me at Suite 26A, 160 E. 38th 
St., New York, N.Y. 10016, or send it directly to Mayor 
Michael Bloomberg, City Hall, New York, N.Y. 10007. It 
will be used against the city's overwhelming $6-billion 
debt. And every little bit helps.

This is the blow I want to strike against Osama bin 
Laden and his terrorists. To help New York City out of 
the financial soup it landed in because of 9/11. If you 
are picky, you can even write on your check how you'd like 
to see your money used in the city -- for education, 
libraries, the homeless, the elderly, parks, transportation, 
sanitation, police, firefighters. But I'm leaving my own 
personal birthday check open for the mayor's idea of 
what the city needs most.

New York doesn't owe me anything, but I owe this city 
everything. And every American should want to help our 
premier metropolis survive. I hope you don't feel offended 
that I've asked for a birthday present. But I'm only going 
to be 80 once. Then, I intend to go back to being 28. 


I WASN'T the only person to think of this, of course. 
Back in November, E.J. Marcus of Manhattan proposed a 
``Save Our City'' group. She hoped to get everyone in 
New York to contribute a dollar a week until the deficit 
was under control, and she wanted school kids to save 
10 cents a week for Gotham. The mayor's office has 
bigger fish to fry than involving itself in public 
generosity or high hopes, so E.J.'s idea is still on 
hold. I just plunged ahead without any real official 
approval. Recently, I forwarded a $10,000 contribution 
from actress Holland Taylor for our public schools. 
(She lives in L.A.) 

Marcus reminded us that years ago, people sent dimes for 
a White House swimming pool for FDR. Lee Iacocca has 
reminded us that the pennies of U.S. school children 
built the base for the Statue of Liberty. We know that 
people are generous at heart, so we shall see what we 
shall see. Happy New Year!
