Hello Everyone--

Happy New Year! Aside from holiday cheer, the New Year means that it is
time for the Search Engine Watch Awards. Be sure to read below in the
newsletter about how you can participate in choosing the best in search for
2002!

========================

Search Engine Strategies Comes To Boston, Sydney

Search Engine Strategies comes to Boston on March 4-6, bringing a variety
of sessions that focus on how to improve editorial listings on search
engines, how to effectively advertise on search engines and a range of
forums that explore various search engine marketing issues. Search engine
marketing experts and representatives from major search engines will be
involved in the show.

The agenda should be live by early next week, if not sooner. Until then,
you can sign-up to be notified about when the agenda is posted, via the URL
below.

assembled an agenda full of search engine marketing topics for the event.
More details can be found below:

The 2002 Search Engine Watch Awards Now Open!

Once again, it's time to recognize the best in search over the past year

"finalists" from the nomination round in these categories:

Yahoo To Buy Inktomi

If all goes as planned, Yahoo will become the proud owner of Inktomi by the
end of March or earlier. The company announced its intention to buy Inktomi
for $235 million on December 23. A look at how the deal may help Yahoo
bring in more searchers, as well as search revenue, can be found in the
article below.

Clearing Your Search History From Google And Other Search Engines

Ever gone to Google or another search engine using the Internet Explorer
browser and noticed that some past searches you've performed were displayed
below the search box? Don't blame (or thank) the search engine. It's your
browser that's keeping the record, and it's one you may find yourself
wishing to delete, from time to time. The article below explores the
procedures involved.

HotBot Is Reborn

Terra Lycos has been saying for ages that the HotBot site was slated for
desperately-needed improvements, and now they've come. And what a welcome
change they are! In one spot, you can now query the important crawler-based
results of FAST/AllTheWeb.com, Google, Inktomi and Teoma. Sadly, you can't
meta search all at the same time. Chris Sherman has an in-depth look in the
SearchDay article below, and I've also included some other views on the
changes.

HotBot is Hot Once Again
SearchDay, Dec. 17, 2002
http://searchenginewatch.com/searchday/02/sd1217-hotbot.html

HotBot has been redesigned for the power searcher, delivering, speed,

HotBot Redesign: Four Search Engines in One
Boston.internet.com, Dec. 16, 2002
http://boston.internet.com/news/article.php/1557361

Terra Lycos plans to promote HotBot through a multi-million dollar ad
campaign. As for this article calling Google the pioneer of the "bare
look," that credit really belongs more to AltaVista. It sported a "clean"
look before Google existed but dropped that look when it aimed to be a
portal.

SearchDay, Dec. 19, 2002
http://searchenginewatch.com/searchday/02/sd1219-vanish.html

More than any other country, the U.S. government has used the web to make a

discovering, the dark side of web-based information is the ease with which
it can be deleted.

intimidating at times, but these glossaries offer definitions and examples
that will get you speaking the lingo in no time.

frustrating if you start by creating a request for proposal that focuses on
your own specific needs.

many types of questions.

Google vs. Evil
Wired, January 2003
http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.01/google_pr.html

Yet another look at issues Google has to deal with at the company matures,
such as pulling content due to legal requirements, trying to balance
principles versus advertising, fighting to reappear in China and the
emerging role that Google cofounder and copresident Sergey Brin is now
playing as policy czar.

========================

The Chain of Demand
Searcher, Jan. 2003
http://www.infotoday.com/searcher/jan03/voice.htm

Wow. US Secretary of State Colin Powell apparently has no encyclopedias,
dictionaries or reference materials in his office, since the web -- and in
particular search engines -- can provide it all. Well, my Random House
Handbook and AP Style Guide still sit happily on my shelf and get the
occasional use. Yeah, search engines are great, but they remain one tool --
not the only tool, for your reference needs. Barbara Quint looks at
Powell's statement and anticipates librarians feeling concerned. She
advocates not a "back to books" campaign but instead a different way of
delivering information electronically.

Worst And Best Picks: Google To IPO?
Forbes, Jan. 6, 2003
http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0106/037_2.html

Buried at the end of this worst/best picks list for 2003 from Forbes is a
statement that Google is set to go public in the first quarter of 2003 and
that it earned $100 million in profit for 2002. However, no attribution of
either statement is provided.

Google Cache Luck!
Search Engine Optimization Forums, Jan. 3, 2003
http://www.supportforums.org/article151.html

Interesting look at how Google apparently generates random file names for

Claims and counter-claims
The Press, Dec. 11, 2002
http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,2135207a28,00.html

New adventure sport for Queenstown, New Zealand. Forget jet boats, bungee
jumping and white water rafting. Now you can debate what's acceptable in
promoting sites on search engines. A tour operator complains that a
marketing company uses duplicate pages and sites, while the marketing
company defends itself by saying if the content matches the search term,
that's not spam. Um, not really. If you are doing things search engines
specifically warn against doing, then regardless of how relevant you think
your content is, the search engines may still view your techniques as
spamming them.

Sites Become Dependent on Google
New York Times, Dec. 9, 2002
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/09/technology/09NECO.html

The "should we fear Google" and "is Google too dominant" questions long
raised online now firmly jump into the traditional media. This New York
Times piece examines the Google dependency that some sites have and how
they fear being cut-off. In case you missed it, my own in-depth look at
these type of issues from October can be found at

My introduction to search engine optimization
Pandia, Dec. 2002
http://www.pandia.com/sw-2002/45-michelle.html

When I was in college in the 80s, no one thought, "I want to be a search
engine marketer." After all, we didn't have search engines! But what's
struck me over the past year is that now we indeed do have people who
aren't transitioning into search engine marketing from other jobs, as was
the case in the 90s, but instead thinking that search engine marketing is
the first job or career they want to undertake. I don't know if SEO is
Michelle Stoltz first job or one she's transitioning to, but regardless,
those established in the industry can follow her thoughts as she discovers
the world of being an SEO consultant for the first time.
