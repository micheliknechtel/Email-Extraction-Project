***Assessment Monographs

The Association for Assessment in Counseling is pleased to announce the
availability of two new monographs for the education and counseling
community:

"Applying the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing - What
Counselors Need to Know" ($10) --

Authors of this monograph reviewed the new Standards for Educational and
Psychological Testing prepared by the American Psychological Corporation,
American Educational Research Association, and National Council on
Measurement in Education. Standards appropriate to counselors were selected,
and the implications in educational and clinical settings were explained.
This document has been reviewed by practicing counselors and assessment
professionals and found to be a "must have" document for current and future
counselors. Counselor educators will find this document especially useful!

"Parents Survival Guide to School Testing"  ($11) --

This monograph has been prepared to address the major questions and concerns
of parents as their sons and daughters participate in school testing
programs. The monograph is written in language that is straightforward and
non-technical. Topics such as why testing is important, score reporting,
rights and responsibilities of test takers are included in the document.
Also included is a copy of the recently released Code of Fair Testing
Practices in Education. The document is practitioner oriented and is useful
for counselors and teachers who need to organize testing programs and
understand and explain results to students and parents.

To order, please download the forms on the AAC website:
<http://aac.ncat.edu>

***Online Accountability for Public Schools

The Center for Education Policy has developed several recommendations to
help citizens and policymakers guide the creation and regulation of K-12
online and virtual schools in ways that will maintain the essential purposes
of public education: effective preparation for life, work, and citizenship;
social cohesion and shared culture; universal access and free cost; equity
and non discrimination; public accountability and responsiveness; and
religious neutrality. For more information go to
http://www.cep-dc.org/democracypublicschools/

***The Impact of School, Family and Community

This report examines the impact of different family and community
connections on student achievement. Authors Anne Henderson and Karen Mapp
reviewed more than 50 research studies published since 1995. They found that
"the research continues to grow and build an ever strengthening case. When
schools, families, and community groups work together to support learning,
children tend to do better in school, stay in school longer, and like school
more." The authors also found that students with involved parents, "no
matter what their income or background", were more likely to succeed in
school, attend school regularly, earn higher grades, pass their classes, and
graduate and go on to post-secondary education. For more information go to
http://www.sedl.org/connections/resources/
