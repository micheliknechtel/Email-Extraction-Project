Welcome back.  We had a nice I-HR break and are now ready to tackle
the HR challenges of 2003. What are they going to be?  Some say a
labor shortage is headed our way
(http://www.christiansciencemonitor.com/2003/0106/p16s02-wmwo.html)
while others say continued layoffs mean continued glut of workers in
need of jobs.

But before we take on anything new, let’s finish up the HR case
study we were discussing at the end of 2003.  The case study is on
Moonlighting and was presented in the Harvard Business Review,
November issue.  We’ve heard from a few I-HR readers with suggestion
on how Melanie, the fictional supervisor, should have handled things
with Jeremy, the moonlighting software engineer.  Now let’s hear
what HBR’s “experts” had to say.

==>TOPIC: MOONLIGHTING CASE STUDY

From: Harvard Business Review Experts

Bill Jensen, CEO of the Jensen Group, a change consulting firm and
author or Work 2.0:Rewriting the Contract:

Mr. Jensen suggests thinking about employees as Investors rather
than as Employees. Companies should recognize that employees make
the choice on where to invest their time and energy.  Does the
employment situation provide a significant return on investment for
the employee?  Mr. Jensen believes that Melanie should not worry
about what Jeremy is doing during his off-hours but instead should
focus on making sure that Jeremy is receiving a significant ROI for
staying involved in Zagrante, the fictional company in the case
study.

Jensen reminds us that there are four key work priorities for
up-and-coming talent.


1)      Highly Interesting Work which is both exciting and meaningful

2)      Ability to work with interesting people

3)      A wonderful place to work

4)      Ability to gather good work experience


His suggestion is for Melanie to find out Jeremy’s wants and needs.
Then go about fulfilling them.


Barry LePartner, founder of Barry B. LePartner & Associates, a New
York law firm:


Not surprisingly, Attorney LePartner (is that an appropriate last
name for a lawyer or what?) suggests that Melanie should have gone
immediately to Jill in Human Resources who should have immediately
called Zagrante’s outside attorneys.  The outside attorneys could
help craft a moonlighting policy that both protects the company and
meets the employees’ needs.  LePartner discusses the problems with
moonlighting as being potential fatigue affecting the employee’s
performance while on the job and the use of company resources.  The
Moonlighting Policy might include a requirement for employees to
disclose their employment status to moonlighting clients and have
them agree to indemnify Zagrante for any liability arising from
their moonlighting activities. Once a Moonlighting Policy has been
drafted, LePartner would remind Jill, the fictional HR Director for
Zagrante to:

1)      Include the policy as part of the Employee Manual of
workplace guidelines

2)      Distribute the policy/manual

3)      Discuss the new policy at a company meeting (together with
management)

4)      Address employees’ concerns

5)      Explain the reasons and rationale behind the policy

Jean Kimmel, Associate Professor of Economics at Western Michigan
University and Karen Conway, Associate Professor of Economics at
University of New Hampshire:

These two associate professors believe that an outright ban on
moonlighting is not justified, cannot be enforced and only alienates
already stressed out employees. Like the others, they suggest that
Zagrante does need a moonlighting policy. They suggest having the
policy be flexible and used as a perk to compensate valuable
employees.  The policy could require prior approval and give
management a chance to discourage the practice for marginal
employees. This managerial approval would allow for individual
discussion and in our fictional case, give Melanie a chance to
discuss whether Jeremy’s productivity was a concern.  The
moonlighting policy should also ban moonlighting on-site. As some of
our I-HR readers discussed, the risk to company hardware/software or
system overload are too great. The professors also note that
“in-your-face” moonlighting might threaten company morale.

Sandra Davis, HR Director for City of Lake Wales, Florida:

Ms. Davis was the only HR Director that HBR consulted with on this
case study.  She shared her experiences with an employee who
moonlighted by running a company on the side while employed with the
City. That would have been fine had he done the work on his own time
but he ran the business on city time and used city employees and
equipment! The City only found out about this through conducting
exit interviews where they learned that employees felt threatened by
the supervisor if they didn’t help him with his private business.
(Another good reason for conducting Exit Interviews!)

For our fictional case, Ms. Davis believes that Melanie should have
stopped Jeremy immediately when she first caught him using company
equipment for his moonlighting assignment.  She could then verify
whether or not Zagrante had a moonlighting policy in place.  If
there was a policy against moonlighting or against using company
equipment for moonlighting, she could have issued Jeremy a verbal
warning and documented it in his file. If he persisted in using
company equipment for freelance work, the documentation of events
would have served as a basis for termination. If no moonlighting
policy existed at Zagrante, Davis suggests that the HR Director Jill
enroll Melanie in helping formulate a new company policy. She also
believes that Melanie is in serious need of some additional
managerial coaching (for allowing her feelings for Jeremy to cloud
her judgment). Plus she would recommends promoting Jeremy which
would provide him with more challenging work and greater income, the
two reasons he was moonlighting in the first place.
