Do You Plan Your Business?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Unemployment levels keep climbing, the stock market keeps falling 
-- what's an entrepreneur to do? Start a business -- but begin by 
writing a business plan. Successful businesses don't just happen; 
they're planned. Already-established companies need business plans, 
too, so they know where they're headed, what difficulties may loom, 
or just to make sure all bases are covered. Read this month's Small 
Business Newsletter to learn the essentials of creating a business 
plan, then make your contribution toward rising employment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Analyze Your Break-Even Point
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Business plans help you start or run an operation with less 
effort and more efficiency. Before you do the work of a complete 
plan, however, consider analyzing your break-even point. It will 
show you how much revenue your business will need to cover your 
expenses. Think of it as a quick way to tell whether your business 
has a chance at actually making more money than it spends. 

In brief, do a break-even analysis by estimating the following 
four items:

  > Fixed costs. These include rent, insurance, utilities 
    and other consistent expenses. Also called "overhead."

  > Sales revenue. Money brought in from sales. Base your 
    forecast on how much business you can reasonably expect 
    to make, not on how much you need for a profit.
 
  > Average gross profit per sale. Average gross profit 
    is what's left after paying the direct costs of a sale.
    (Direct costs can be thought of as the cost of goods 
    sold.) This figure can help you understand how much 
    money will become available to the business on each 
    sale you make.
	
  > Average gross profit percentage. Calculate your average 
    gross profit percentage (profit margin) by dividing 
    average gross profit per sale by the average selling 
    price. (This shows you how much you're making above 

Do you have the above numbers? Then it's easy to calculate the 
break-even point. Divide estimated annual fixed costs by the 
gross profit percentage. This gives you the amount of sales 
revenue you'll need to break even. For example, if your fixed 
costs are $5,000 per month with an expected profit percentage 
of 50 percent, your monthly break-even point is $10,000 in 
sales ($5,000 divided by .50).

This kind of analysis is an excellent screen with which to 
sift business ideas. If it demonstrates likely positive cash 
flow, then the business is a good candidate for an in-depth 
analysis: The business plan.

Free Mini Business Planner
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Quicken(R) and Palo Alto Software have teamed up to provide you with 
a free mini business planner in Quicken Home & Business (introduced 
with Quicken 2002). Go to the Business menu and select Mini Business

idea, whether you're starting a business or already running one.

idea into a comprehensive business plan using Business Plan Pro. 
It's easy to use, offers a lot of help as you create your plan, 
and is flexible enough to handle any business. Plus, it uses the 
information you entered into your Quicken software's Mini Business 
Planner, so you don't have to start over.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Main Goals of a Business Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------------
There are two main goals of a business plan: financial data that 
shows money-making potential, plus fundamental ideas behind the 
business. Why should you plan? Many entrepreneurs think that their 
time would be better spent making sales calls or refining products. 
However, with a plan, you'll be able to see what makes your business 
unique -- and therefore valuable. A plan will also keep your business 
focused on its best features, while avoiding potential pitfalls.

If you're starting a business, your plan should focus on presenting 
your idea in a compelling way, in order to attract investors or 
lenders. If you already have a business, the plan is used more to 
refine the direction you hope to take the business.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Refine Your Existing Business
-----------------------------------------------------------------
If you're looking to refine an existing business, your business 
plan will have a different focus. Financial projections and 
competitive analysis become the dominant themes. You already have 
a break-even analysis; now you'll need a profit-and-loss forecast 
and cash-flow projections. P/L forecasts use the sales and expense 
forecasts from the break-even analysis to create month-by-month 
profit projections. Cash flow shows you where cash might fall short 
in a certain month, so you can arrange a line of credit to cover 
yourself. In addition, look at each area of the business and decide 
what its most important contribution is toward profitability.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Lease Business Property
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Do you use personal property in your business? Lease it to the 
business. This allows you to get personal money in the form of 
lease income, which can then be reduced by taking a depreciation 
expense on your personal tax form. Your business saves because 
the lease income payment isn't taxed for Social Security purposes. 

A business plan can give you a leg up on your competitors -- not 
having one may mean your business never gets a chance to run.
