No Rerun Rally

Bush’s speech may have been today, but the rally was yesterday.
Plus: good news from EMC, and a strike at GE?


Jan 07 2003
By Andy Serwer
Fortune.com



Chicago! Chicago! Hey, forget about Catherine Zeta-Jones, the
real star of the Windy City today was President George W. Bush,
who announced his economic stimulus plan. Bottom line: It had all
pretty much been leaked out. Market already rallied off this one
on Monday, so we didn’t get a rerun on Tuesday. A rosy forecast
from EMC helped techs. The Dow fell 32 to 8740, while the Naz
climbed 10 to 1431. Hey watch me, Joseph Campbell (Follow your
bliss, kids, always follow your bliss…), I mean Andy Serwer, on
CNN’s "American Morning with Paula Zahn," and Headline News. Read
Loose Change to get my take on LL Cool J. Here’s wazzup:

STOCKYARD: As for W.’s plan, a little bigger than we had thought--$674
million--but eliminating the dividend cut. A vigorous defense was
mounted however by Don Evans and others, claiming the Dem plan
was lame. Now the fun begins as Congress hashes it out. I really
think that W. has done a pretty good job of preempting the Dems.
Who knows if any of these plans work? Deficit looming larger.
Wonder if the NYT is right that 1) this whole dividend thing was
Charles Schwab’s idea; and 2) if it will make muni bonds less
attractive and thereby increase borrowing costs for states. Note
that states where Dems are more ascendant gets more from the Dem
plan than from W.’s plan. Coincidence? Me thinks not! Hey, I
know! Let’s give a tax break to North Korea! Buy ‘em out. We pay
Kim Jong Il money, he leaves and gives us nukes! Hey, GE’s big
union is calling a big national strike. Issues over medical
benefits. Hey, Jeff Immelt! Didn’t you come from medical systems?
Heard about this big brouhaha over Coca-Cola and some bottling
plant in India where Coke is suing over water. Anyone know about
that? So, EMC FINALLY HAD SOME GOOD NEWS! Outlook is better and
stock climbs 66 cents to $7.46…Have you checked out Porsche’s new
SUV, the Cayenne? WHAT a tamale!

GRIM HEADLINE OF THE DAY: "World airline industry loses $13
billion in 2002." Fly me to the moon…

BEARS: Do you know from bears? I know Grizzlies, blacks, polars,
etc, but I’m reading a pretty good book by Lynn Schooler (a he)
called "Blue Bear," which he says is a rare kind of bear in lower
Alaska also known as the glacier bear. Only thing is when I look
‘blue bear’ up, it looks like the blue bear is just a phase that
a common black bear goes through. Huh? Help me out on this one!

BIG SHOUT TO ANYONE IN LITTLE ROCK! Tell me your favorite restaurant
there! E-mail me!

Loose ChangeHEY, THE CANCUN RECOMMENDATIONS are coming on Thursday.
Stay tuned! DEEP BLUE ON STIMULUS PLAN: "They should just give
the big cuts to folks with AGI under 50k. They'll spend it,
generate sales tax $$, and put it back in the economy -- People
like me and you will just sit on it and put in a college fund. We
are too practical. Here is what I want with my tax cut -- The
Independence Classic be still my nautical heart…this boat is so,
so cool...beyond cool -- it's fiberglass, but looks like a woodie
from the 1920's. I'd throw in a 240-horsepower Mercury Sport Jet,
bow thruster and the double cockpit. I'm King of Lake George! For
$55,000." Great idea, Blue! READER SAYS: "I read the NY Times on
my commute in and they always refer to the results of any tax
relief as 'costing the government $X billion' rather than 'Saving
the taxpayers $X billion.' Why the phraseology (I say it's liberal
bias)? I have written countless letters to the editor to no
avail. It's our money in the first place. Did the quarter I
declined to give to the homeless man on the subway this morning
cost him 25 cents?--Matthew"…ALSO: "As with you, Yahoo Finance
was down for me yesterday morning. I stepped over to a friend’s
(pretty hardcore tech person, mind you) office to see if they
could get to it...they could. So I asked, ‘If we're in the same
office, why can you get to it and I can't?’ ‘I don't know,’ she
replied, ‘maybe you hit a bad hub.’ Believe or not, she said,
‘You should reboot and see if you hit a good one...’ So I did,
and it worked. It's great working for a technology giant!"…AS FOR
THE GIANTS, hey, it’s ALL the ref’s fault. Him and Cris Collingworth!
Can’t believe Pitt beat ND! Is Pitt really any good? Went to a
Columbia Lions hoops game last night. More people went to my high
school games! Heartbreak! Lions lost to Sacred Heart (Fairfield,
CT) on a 3-point shot with two seconds left! Pioneers had kids
from all over--only two from CT--favorite was named Mading Mading
from somewhere in Africa. He didn’t play…LL Cool J. does "Harry
Potter:" "It’s Slitherin, baby! Go ahead, baby!" Yeah!
