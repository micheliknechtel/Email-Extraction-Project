Friday, January 10, 2003
------------------------------------------------------

January is probably not the best time to go on a honeymoon. Just ask
Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy. Their new movie, Just Married, hurls
the pair into a honeymoon trip from hell. Judging by the reviews,
critics are less than pleased to be along for the ride. Luckily, this is
not the only movie opening this week. Narc will fit the bill if you're
into cop thrillers. Ray Liotta and Jason Patric are superb in this. If
you're a fan of Michael Cunningham's book The Hours, then you should to
be glad to hear that the movie does the book justice. Don't be too
surprised to find the leads being recognized come awards time. Antwone
Fisher, Denzel Washington's directorial debut, is expanding into more
theaters this week. It may a familiar tale, but it's a familiar tale
well told. Spike Lee's new feature, The 25th Hour, has been described as
his best since Do the Right Thing by some and an interesting failure by
others, but the majority of the critics seem to like it. Follow the link
below to find out about the limited releases.
