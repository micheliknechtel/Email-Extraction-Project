              You really can learn things in Lamaze
             classes.  I learned that just because a
            video has a naked lady in it doesn't mean
          that my "bawm-chick-a-bamp bamp" song is going
          to automatically get a laugh out of the room.

               I'd like to send a picture of myself
                to some distant star, thousands of
              light-years away, because by the time
               the aliens realize I'm mooning them,
                I'll have been dead for centuries.

                        (Jeffrey Lampert)
