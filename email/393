Authors Note:- :Let's Make 2003 A Fit, Healthy & Happy Year

Welcome back to 'Fitness for Life' for 2003 and I trust 
all readers had a fantastic Christmas and New Year. 

Having enjoyed a short but enjoyable Christmas 
vacation, I have restored my batteries and am ready to 
make 2003 a year of achieving goals.

Talk about goals, January is a typical period when 
many of us make a few new years resolutions. Two weeks 
on, I wonder how many readers out there are still 
committed to their new year resolutions?? 

I prefer to call my new years resolutions, yearly 
goals. You can specify your goals into categories, 
as financial, health, fitness, career, family or 
just list a few things you really want to achieve. 
The most important thing though, is to commit to 
your goals. Just wishing out loud might make you 
feel positive for a few minutes, but unless you are 
committed to your goals, most will merely fall by the 
'I wish, but never did' list.

For the record, a couple of my 2003 goals include 
making my mark as a competitive marathon runner, and to 
spend more time developing my business. So what's are 
your 2003 goals??

Readers Goals.

Share your goals and let me help keep you motivated to 
keep on the right path. Just email me your goals and 
I will provide some useful tips on the best way to achieve them.

Send your 2003 fitness/health goals to: 
WelEdit@Laughmeister.com

Finally, let's make 2003 a fit, healthy and happy year 
and one to not just set, but to achieve some important 
goals. With a little dedication, and a bit of effort, 
I am sure you can.

Cheers

Feature Article...................

KICK START YOUR 2003 FITNESS RESOLUTION

I have viewed with interest recent newspapers and 
magazines, listing the new years resolutions of readers 
and celebrities. Once again losing weight, getting 
fit and generally focusing on one's health, tops the 
list. With recent statistics showing 
the Western world has ever increasing levels of 
cardiovascular disease, being overweight, obesity, 
cancers, depression, inactivity, and in many lifestyle 
diseases, I am not surprised.

Coming up with your new years resolutions is the 
easy part, setting the wheels in motion and following 
your resolutions through is the tough part. In 
reality, we tend to make a great start, then within a 
couple of weeks, motivation wanes and once again our goals take 
a back seat to our busy life schedules. Excuses are plentiful 
and little is achieved.

So what is the secret to sticking to your new years 
health and fitness resolution(s)? 

Personally, I believe that you have to have a clear 
picture of what your goals are and why you want to 
achieve them. The next key step is to plan accordingly 
and finally to be dedicated to achieving your goals.

* Goal Setting.
Spend time thinking about ways to enrich and 
improve your life. Give your goals plenty of thought. Ask 
yourself, are they realistic and specific? What is the best 
way to go about achieving them? What time frame do you 
allocate yourself to achieving them? Do you have some 
smaller goals to achieve along the road to your main goals? 
Is there someone or a service that can help you along the 
path to achieving your goals?

* Plan for success.

Have you considered what is the best approach to 
achieving your health and fitness goals? Have you 
considered family, work and general lifestyle issues? What 
weekly exercise, diet and stress management regime will 
you follow? How many days per week can you realistically 
allocate towards your fitness regime? What time is best for 
you to exercise? Have you considered your current fitness, 
age, physical condition, and previous experiences? 
Is it best to join a gymnasium, enrol in a sports club, 
fitness class, weight loss clinic or to hire the services 
of a personal trainer? Do you have a friend who would 
be interested in exercising together with you? Can you begin 
a weekly early morning walking group with friends/neighbours? 

* Dedication
Remember, goals will get you to make a start. Planning will 
set you off on the right path. But dedication, and only 
dedication will ultimately get you success. Achieving change 
is not easy, but the rewards and the road to better health and 
fitness is extremely rewarding. 

Approach each day at a time- baby steps is the key. Make 
a start and make it happen!

                  Health News

US President Leads By Example

US President George W Bush, an avid exerciser, 
declared regular exercise and a nutritious diet a 
matter of patriotism, after more recent studies 
raising the alarm over Americans' poor fitness and health.
"If you're interested in improving America, you can 
do so by taking care of your own body," he said as 
he launched a physical fitness campaign.

"The evidence is clear, a healthier America is a 
stronger America."

He said the campaign rested on four principles: 
preaching the value of 30 minutes of exercise daily; 
urging Americans to adopt a healthier diet; calling 
on them to take advantage of preventive disease 
screenings and getting them to stop smoking, taking 
drugs, and drinking excessively.

Bush, a passionate fitness buff who at 55 years of 
age jogs and lifts weights regularly, pledged to 
lead by example, saying: "Exercise is a part of my 
daily life. It kind of helps me deal with the stress 
a little better."

"After a get a good run in, I even like the press 
corps a lot better. I don't know if they like me a lot 
better after my run. But I value exercise. It's an 
important part of a balanced life''

Quote of the Week

"He who cherishes a beautiful vision, a lofty 
ideal in his heart, will one day realize it. Dream 
lofty dreams and as you dream so shall you become..
