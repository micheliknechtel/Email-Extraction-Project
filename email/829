Philadelphia - a city that's going places

Despite being America's fifth-largest city, Philadelphia has in the past been 
overshadowed by the celebrity metropolises of New York and Washington DC to its 
north and south. That is all beginning to change, however, as the historic town 
emerges as one of the nation's hottest destinations.

This is a city where old and new blend together to create an ambience that is 
truly unique. On the one hand you have more historic buildings than any other 
American city, ranging from the colonial homes of Society Hill and the Georgian 
mansions in Fairmount Park to the Gothic masterpieces on Boathouse Row. On the 
other you have the rapid development of Philly's waterfront area into an 
unrivalled venue for entertainment and shopping.

William Penn might not have been able to predict the future when he founded 
Philadelphia in 1682, but his vision for the town he dubbed the City of 
Brotherly Love is still evident today. Laid out in straight-angle grids with 
broad, tree lined streets, the multitude of modern attractions now thronging the 
sidewalks do so in the atmosphere of space and light originally envisioned by 
their Quaker architect.

Lovers of that old-time feel will go for some of the city's long-running 
pleasures. Whether attending a Philadelphia Orchestra concert, lingering over 
the quintessentially American paintings of Benjamin West in the ornate 
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts or touring Independence Hall, home of the 
world famous Liberty Bell, a soul-restoring time is virtually guaranteed.

Those seeking more modern pleasures are equally well served. Thanks to a roster 
of exciting festivals, new theaters, major art exhibitions, some of the nation's 
best restaurants and a pulsating nightlife, Philly is on the money every time.

Like most large cities, Philadelphia has had its problems in the past. Crime has 
plummeted by 30% since 1992 however, and now previously homeless people have 
been hired to clean streets, remove graffiti, serve as guides and work in 
partnership with the police to make this a safe and welcoming time.

Give Philly a try. You certainly won't regret it.

When to go

Philadelphia is a year-round city, with a variety of popular annual events 
taking place across the calendar. The period around July 4th is particularly 
festive due to the town's famous Independence Day celebrations. The concert and 
theater seasons traditionally run from October through to June, though the sight 
of blooming cherry trees makes Spring an excellent time to visit.

Like most other northern American cities, Philly can be hot and humid in the 
summer and cold in winter, with an average snowfall of 21 inches.

Five things to try

Start off by going to jail at Eastern State penitentiary in the heart of the 
city. Built in 1829 as a revolutionary new design that went on to influence 
penal institutions from China to South America, before its closure in 1971 the 
prison was home to such luminaries as Al Capone, Willie Sutton and Pep, a dog 
convicted of killing the governor's wife's cat. The tours are well-conducted and 
great fun, with special events taking place around Bastille Day and Halloween.

Spend a day at the Franklin Institute on Benjamin Franklin Parkway at 20th St 
(tel: 215-448-1200). This large museum contains four floors of exhibitions and 
artifacts tracing the history of science, with plenty of hands-on demonstrations 
that make this a choice spot for people with kids. The building has its own 
restaurant, not to mention a planetarium show, park and IMAX movie theater.

Visit Penn's Landing, the spot where the town began, in the Old City (tel: 215-
923-8181). Although retaining much of its original character the area is now a 
packed entertainment and historic theme park, with ships, a marina, numerous 
restaurants and bars, live music in an outdoor amphitheatre, ethnic festivals, a 
skating rink and ice hockey games. 

Grab a slice of real Philly life at the Italian Market, which is located on the 
section of 9th Street between Wharton and Christian Streets. Crammed with 
stallholders selling meat, fish, game, vegetables, fruit and flowers, this 
bustling venue has become a must-see multi-cultural shopping and people-watching 
experience.

Indulge in some retail therapy along Market and Chestnut Streets, both of which 
are lined with shops malls selling all manner of designer items. Ranging from 
tiny stalls to ornate fashion salons, there's something here to suit every taste 
and budget. Particularly worth trying is The Gallery on Market St East (215-625-
4962), which contains over 170 shops, eateries and cafés on four levels. 

Five places to eat

A real gem is the Nodding Head Brewery and Restaurant at 1516 Sansom St (215-
569-9525). Great local beers, excellent food, a speakeasy atmosphere and 
extremely good value for money have made this a favorite venue for families and 
partygoers alike.

Walk to Reading Terminal Market between 11th St and Arch St (215-592-9772) to 
sample the delights of this chain-free hodgepodge of eateries and fast food 
stands. For the authentic Philadelphia eating experience, make sure you try the 
locally made Pretzels at least once.

The Marathon Grill at 2201 Market St (215-568-7766) is another little-known 
local favorite. Offering take-out and sit down meals, the affordable menu makes 
this an excellent place to grab a quick bite - especially at breakfast time, 
when the Grill's platter is simply unbeatable.

Pop in for the popular Sunday brunch at the Fountain Restaurant in the Four 
Seasons Hotel at 1 Logan Square on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway (215-963-1500), 
renowned for its high quality. A firm favorite with the locals, the atmosphere 
is lively and a group plays classical jazz throughout.

Tucked away in a pretty row of houses at 251-253 South Camac St is The Inn 
Philadelphia (215-732-2339), a two-story, non-smoking restaurant with several 
dining rooms, a large piano bar and a "secret garden" where patrons can dine 
when it's not too cold outside. Elegant, classy and romantic, this historic 
venue is a culinary experience not to be missed.

Philadelphia's Neighborhoods

Downtown Philadelphia is referred to as Center City. This covers 30 blocks from 
the Delaware River on the east end to the Schuykill River on the west side, as 
far north as Spring Garden Street and south to South Street. But within this 
area there are even more neighborhoods.

Start your visit in the neighborhood around Independence Hall, where the Liberty 
Bell rang out and where the Declaration of Independence, the United States 
Constitution and the Bill of Rights were written and signed. This is Society 
Hill, where you can tour Independence National Park, do some shopping and have a 
cocktail at an intimate bar, head up the block to a play, and then round off the 
day with a jumping night out.

North of Market Street is Old City, Philadelphia's version of New York's Soho. 
Packed with restaurants, small art galleries and a growing number of design 
firms, this is where the young hip scene hangs out.

East of Old City, along the Delaware River, Penn's Landing is a backdrop for 
outdoor festivals and free summer concerts, as well as fireworks on holidays. 
You can take a ferry across the river to the aquarium or visit the open-air 
clubs north of the Ben Franklin Bridge to take advantage of the breathtaking 
view. 

West of Old City between 8th and 13th Streets is Chinatown. Half Chinese and 
half a combination of Vietnamese, Thai, Japanese, Burmese and Pan-Asian, this 
thriving section rivals any Chinatown in the country.

On the west end of Center City is the fashionable Rittenhouse Square district, 
where you can buy great clothing and then wear it to dinner at the place next 
door.

Getting around

Philadelphia is a city built for easy walking, but you can hail taxis on the 
street, at the ranks outside hotels or at the 30th St Station and the 
Greyhound/Trailways terminal on Filbert St. Yellow Cab (215- 829-4222) and Bell 
Taxi Service (215- 634-4444) both operate a 24-hr service.

SEPTA controls the local transport of over ground rail, bus and trolley cars. 
Suburban Station and Market East Station are the main terminals for the business 
district, with both connecting the entire system to the Airport Rail Line (R1). 
Trains service the suburbs while Center City is served by buses and streetcars. 

Tickets for most routes on all transit systems cost around $2 in exact change. 
For multiple day-trips use a SEPTA Day Pass that allows unlimited daily travel 
on all city transport, plus a one-way trip on the Airport Line. For travel 
details and a map, call 215- 580-7800. 

Also worth trying are the Line trolleys that loop along 11th St & 12th St 
between Noble and Fitzwater. A round trip costs around 50c and passes through 
some of the best shopping and sightseeing areas.
