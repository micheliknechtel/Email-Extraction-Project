SHADOWRAM REPORT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sun channel chief Gary Grimes has some work to do inside his company 
regarding the vendor's plans to sell solutions rather than products.

A solution provider on the Sun ONE VAR Council, which met last 
Wednesday in Dallas, said there is confusion within the Sun ONE 
organization about Sun's overall plan to sell solutions comprised of 
all of its products rather than hardware and software separately. 

He said some folks in the Sun ONE organization were not aware of a 
recent Sun deal to bundle the BEA WebLogic Application Server with 
the administrator's kit of the latest update of Solaris, a move that 
may impact Sun's own software strategy. (The Sun ONE Application 
Server already is built directly into the Solaris OS.) Also, the 
solution provider said the overall health of Sun ONE partners is not 
good, reflecting that business in the Sun ONE unit is slow, too. 

Is "resting comfortably" after a motorcycle crash an oxymoron? Let's 
hope not. David Crossmier, CTO of Channel Intelligence, an ASP that 
links solution providers to manufacturers, found himself in this 
position last week after a motorcycle accident. Crossmier led the 
team that developed the database underneath the Channel Intelligence 
service, which the company claims drove almost $3 billion worth of 
leads in the channel in the past fiscal year. 

So far, 50 manufacturers have joined, and the company is adding 
about 12 per month to the list. Look for Crossmier to add a range of 
applications in 2003,but maybe the company's board should first add a 
"no-motorcycles" clause to his contract.

Meanwhile, reports of this demise were greatly exaggerated: A photo 
of Richard Clarke, President Bush's cybersecurity chief, erroneously 
appeared in an obituary for another Richard Clarke, former chairman 
and CEO of Pacific Gas and Electric, in The San Francisco Chronicle 
last month. The newspaper published a correction with a photo of the 
correct Clarke.

You know the stories about the landscaper's yard that's choked with 
weeds? That trend carries over to the high-tech business as well. A 
small West Coast solution provider called us the other day and said 
one of her customers had an ongoing hardware problem with a recently 
installed (and still under warranty) Compaq server. She called 
Hewlett-Packard to request a dispatch of a Compaq/HP engineer but was 
told the "case server" was down and had been down for several hours. 

The solution provider suggested an HP service person call her back 
but was told that might not happen before 5 p.m., so an engineer 
wouldn't be dispatched until the following day. When the solution 
provider reminded HP about its warranty response time commitment, the 
response was that it pertained "when possible."
