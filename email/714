Dear Yucksters, 

Have you heard about this new reality TV series called "Joe 
Millionaire?" The idea is that handsome, young "Joe" has 
recently inherited $50 million, and now he has agreed to 
interview and date 20 prospective fiancees, all on camera, 
to see which one he will propose to. 

The catch is that "Joe" really didn't inherit $50 million at 
all. He's a construction worker who pulls down about $19,000 
a year, lives in a one bedroom apartment with his cat and 
spends a lot of time playing Nintendo and eating cold pizza. 

No millions, no castle, no horses, no sports cars. On the 
plus side he's still young and handsome. The point is to see 
if true love will conquer materialism. 

I think it should be called, "Joe Gets His Eyes Clawed Out 
When His Fiancee Finds Out She's Been Played For a Rube On 
National Television." 

Laugh it up,

Joe

At a dinner party, the speaker who was the guest of honor 
was about to deliver his speech when his wife, who was 
sitting at the other end of the table, sent him a piece of 
paper with the word "KISS" scribbled on it.

A guest seated next to the speaker said, "It looks like 
your wife has sent you a kiss for good luck. She must love 
you very much."

The speaker replied, "You don't know my wife. The letters 
stand for "Keep it short, Stupid."

"Dad," said Little Johnny, "I'm late for football practice. 
Would you please do my homework for me?" 

The father said irately, "Son, it just wouldn't be right." 

"That's okay," replied Little Johnny, "but you could at 
least give it a try, couldn't you?"


*------------- Guaranteed to Roll Your Eyes ---------------*

A blind man with his seeing eye dog walked into a bar.

The blind man picked up the dog and swung it around and 
around over his head.

The bartender runs up and asks, "Man, What the heck are 
you doing?"

The blind man replies, "Just taking a look around."
