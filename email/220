If your retirement accounts have been suffering during this 3 year bear
market, here's an opportunity to learn how to retire successfully.

Next week, in the Seattle area, CBS Marketwatch columnist and money
manager Paul Merriman is offering two free workshops that will show you
strategies that have made money for the past 33 years, including 2000,
2001, and 2002!  Paul will show you how to design a personal retirement
portfolio using no-load mutual funds, how to avoid common mistakes that
have devastated investors during this bear market, and how to use the best
mutual funds at Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard.

account for better results at less risk.  You are welcome to attend the
full workshop, or just come for the Boeing session, which begins each day
at about 3:45 p.m.
