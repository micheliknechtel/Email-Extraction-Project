      <p><font face="Arial" size=2>Dear Joe,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size=2>I'm extremely excited to announce that a small 
        handful of licenses for the <em>&quot;Business-In-A-Box&quot;</em> packages 
        I offered last June have come available, which means a very limited few 
        of you have this one last chance to...</font></p>
      <div align="center"><font face="Arial" size=2><b>Start selling your very 
        own <u>high-profit</u>, hot-selling <br>
        <i>info-product</i> -- without writing a single word!</b></font> <font face="Arial" size=2> 
        </font></div>
      <font face="Arial" size=2>
      <p>... In case this doesn't ring any bells, I am talking about a business-in-a-box 
        that is <b>literally a complete turnkey solution</b> for you to start 
        making money on the Internet selling in-demand tools and resources to 
        an enormous online market.</p>
      <p>Over the past five years, I've received tons of requests from customers 
        and subscribers like you who are looking for <i>&quot;ready-to-sell&quot;</i> 
        products that can be used to:</p>
      </font> 
      <table width="95%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
        <tr align="left" valign="top"> 
          <td width="9%" align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1)</font></td>
          <td width="91%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Start 
            your own business on the Internet with an in-demand product that allows 
            you to <b>keep 100% of the profits </b>-- and <i>costs you nothing 
            to produce.</i></font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="left" valign="top"> 
          <td width="9%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Or</font></td>
          <td width="91%">&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="left" valign="top"> 
          <td width="9%" align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2)</font></td>
          <td width="91%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Explode 
            the profits from your existing customers and subscribers by <b>adding 
            an additional product -- one that doesn't cost a cent to develop</b>

      ... <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If you've been a 
      customer or subscriber of the Internet Marketing Center for any length of 
      time, you know that we listen to what our customers ask for. And this recurring 
      request for an <u>online product solution</u> was something we could NOT 
      ignore. </font><font face="Arial" size=2><br>
      <p>So after a ton of research and development, we personally selected four 
        sought-after information products, written by a well-known industry expert, 
        for you to choose from. Each product comes with a complete turnkey solution 
        that includes...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The ever-so-critical sales material that would normally cost $7,000+ 
          to develop -- <em>at no cost! </em>This tried and tested sales material 
          is completely necessary to <b>guarantee that these products are the 
          #1 bestsellers</b> your new e-business or existing Web venture needs 
          to increase your profits!<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>A complete package including a ready-to-produce information product 
          that can be <i>delivered electronically at no cost</i> or shipped in 
          hard-copy format (fulfilled by the company of your choice or the one 
          we recommend) for only a few dollars.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>A <i>step-by-step action plan that walks you through the essential 
          steps</i> to get your new product up and running on the Internet as 
          quickly as possible -- <b>from set-up and production, right through 
          to profit generation and fulfillment!</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is NOT an affiliate program... these are tested and proven products 
        created by a sought-after industry leader who charges $500+ per hour for 
        his time... and when you <i>choose one or all</i> of these powerful turnkey 
        business solutions you <u>keep 100% of the profits</u> for the rest of 
        your life! </p>
      <p><u>Important Note</u><b>: </b>Because the <i>&quot;risk-free&quot;</i> 
        guarantee literally<b> guarantees you make money or you don't pay</b>, 
        we have limited this opportunity to only 100 licenses for reprint rights 
        for each of the four products.</p>
      <p>And it is only because a small handful of our customers did NOT take 
        full advantage of their licenses that we now have <strong> an extremely 
        limited number available</strong>, all of which we expect to be <em>snatched 
        up overnight! </em> </p>
      <p>So do not hesitate. To choose any one, or even all four of the businesses-in-a-box 
        and <i>start selling online in the next 24 hours</i>, go to:</p>
