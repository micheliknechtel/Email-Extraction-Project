Greetings Bible Enthusiast! 

Have you ever heard of the expression "Adam's ale"?
Well, presumably, the first man had only water to
drink.  So, "Adam's ale" is a quaint way of referring
to water.

The next time someone asks you if you've got something
to drink, you can reply, "Sure, how about a little 
"Adam's ale?"

I just thought you might like to know that - just in
case you didn't already!

Have a wonderful day!

--FEATURED FUNNY: JOHNNY AND THE WHALE:

  Little Johnny was at Sea World, and was having a 
  wonderful time; but he absolutely refused to go to
  the show to see Shamu, the killer whale.  He would
  not say why he didn't want to go, and nothing
  grandma, grandma, mom, or dad said would change 
  his mind about it.

  Later, after he got home and was snuggling into
  his bed to go to sleep, he finally told his
  Mom his reason:.

  "Mommy," he said, "I didn't want to go see Shamu
  because yesterday Aunt Susie told me how exciting
  the show would be because they 'pick children from
  the audience to feed Shamu.'"

--ANSWER TO TRIVIA QUESTION: 

  Q.  What is the longest word in the Bible?
 
  A.  Mahershalalhashbaz
      It's the name of Isaiah's son

      See Isaiah 8:1

      "The LORD said to me, 'Take a large scroll and 
      write on it with an ordinary pen:
      Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.'" 

      This name means quick to the plunder, swift 
      to the spoil.
