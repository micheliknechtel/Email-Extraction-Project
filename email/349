Hi Gas Engine folks,

I have a German Motorcycle Magazine article on testing of various kinds of
Spark Plugs tested on a 2002 BMW R1150GS Motorcycle.  These motorcycles
have been quite notorious for having a Part Throttle Surging problem.
Basically this is because of running very lean EPA Mandated air-fuel
mixture during steady state highway cruising.  A Check Republic company
called "Brisk" (http://www.brisk.cz) has developed a Spark Plug that
eliminates this problem via an extremely long spark length between the
Electrodes tips.  They claim the spark always jumps between the electrode
points (arrayed 360 Degrees around) with the highest air/fuel
concentration.  The tip is positioned deep in the combustion chamber.  They=

also claim increase flame front speed in the beginning phase of the flame
front propagation which they say promotes more complete burning.

Diese Funkenlage gestattet einen extrem langen Gleitfunken, der rundum
(360=B0) =FCberspringen kann. Der Funke =FCberspringt immer an dem Punkt mi=
t der
h=F6chsten Kraftstoffkonzentration. Die Funkenlage der BRISK PREMIUM LGS
Z=FCndkerze ist tief in den Brennraum vorgeschoben. Eine wesentlich h=F6her=
e
Verbrennungs- Geschwindigkeit in der Anfangsphase der Flammenverbreitung im=

Brennraum gestattet vollkommene Ausnutzung der Kraftstoffenergie. Die
Verbrennungs- Geschwindigkeit zusammen mit den Klopfsensoren sorgen f=FCr d=
ie
Erh=F6hung der Motorleistung.

The Motorcycle magazine test article is in the FALL2002 "BMW" special issue=

of Motorrad-Magazin MO (http://www.mo-web.de/) under the title
"Konstant-Fahrruckeln: Ursache und Abhilfe" (Constant - Surging: Cause and
Remedy).  They have a graph of Engine Torque using various brands and type
of Sparkplugs from Brisk, Bosch, ND, and NGK.  It looks like an average
torque increase of ~3 nM. is achieved with the Brisk DOR14LGS Spark Plug.
They also conform the elimination of the notorious surging problem using
the BRISK Spark Plug and the recommended change interval is 30kM
(18.6kMiles)...this is a long time considering that Motorcycles typically
run in the 3000 to 4000 RPM range during highway cruising.  Typical change
interval is 6000 miles on Motorcycles using regular Spark Plugs so this is
a 3 fold increase in spark plug life.

Regards, Chris Barnes
