THE LOWDOWN ON FLATPANEL TVS
----------------------------

If you've been shopping for TVs recently, you may have noticed
the growing availability of flat-panel TVs on our website. With
their sharp, vivid pictures and remarkable placement versatility,
these innovative models are redefining the way we think about TV.

Flat-panel TVs, based on either LCD or plasma technology, create
images by using a flat grid of pixels instead of the scanning
electron gun and bulky picture tube found in conventional TVs.
Consequently, you get more options for placement and use because
of their light weight and shallow depth. Here's a quick look at
both technologies:

-- Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) --

An LCD TV uses a lamp to shine light through a display that
consists of 2 panels sandwiching a liquid crystal solution. When
an electrical current is passed through the liquid, the crystals
align to either allow light to shine through or to block it, and
the pattern of transparent and dark crystals form the image. LCD
TVs are a great choice for video game fans because there's
absolutely no chance of image burn-in.

Samsung's 17" widescreen LTM1775W includes a built-in stand that
can be detached for mounting it on a wall or under a counter
using optional brackets. It's PC-compatible, and can even display
TV and PC signals simultaneously -- you can watch TV while you
surf the Web!

Though it's not, strictly speaking, a flat-panel model, Sony's
XBR Grand Wega KF-60XBR800 60" LCD projection TV uses flat-panel
technology to create a big, bright picture in a surprisingly slim
cabinet. The XBR Grand Wega LCD projection display is so packed
with pixels (1366 x 768), that it handles even your most
demanding sources (like hi-def broadcasts and progressive-scan
DVD) effortlessly. Its smaller cabinet size relative to a
conventional big-screen TV makes it a good fit for a wider range
of room sizes.

   http://www.crutchfield.com/news.asp?a=4982&b=1105318&c=UL217


-- Plasma --

A plasma TV's display is self-lighting, consisting of a thin
layer of pixels in between 2 glass panels. Each pixel is composed
of 3 gas-filled cells or sub-pixels (one each for red, green, and
blue). An electrical current applied to these cells causes them
to glow. The result is an accurate and precise display with high,
even light output, and the ability to produce over 16 million
colors.

Sony's 42" KE-42XBR900 XBR Plasma Wega features Sony's
proprietary Wega Engine video processing system, which combines
several state-of-the-art picture-improving technologies for
maximum clarity and accuracy of motion. HDTV images are rendered
with striking detail and depth, while regular analog sources are
upconverted to near-HD quality. An elegant "floating glass"
design gives this highly advanced plasma TV a striking look.

MASS MUSIC FOR THE ROAD
-----------------------

Tired of fumbling around for a CD or cassette, or endless station
surfing to find just the right tunes when you're on the road? You
don't have to anymore -- new technologies put you in control by
making it easy to access huge digital music libraries on your
vehicles sound system.

Today's mass music options include CD/MP3 changers, mobile
digital music players, and Satellite Radio. They're relatively
easy upgrades for just about any car audio setup, and make
whatever time you spend on the road safer and a lot more fun.

-- Add-on Multi-Disc MP3 --

The convenience and flexibility of the MP3 format continue to
make mobile MP3 gear one of our hottest product categories. You
can add MP3 capability to any in-dash FM radio with an add-on
CD/MP3 changer like the Sony 10-disc CDX-565MXRF. Once you load
it up with your home-burned CD-Rs and CD-RWs, youve got easy
access to nearly 100 hours of your favorite digital music.

-- Kenwood Mobile Jukebox --

Kenwood's KHD-C710 Music Keg lets your take an even more
extensive music library on the road with you. Its 10-gigabyte
storage cartridge puts up to 2,500 digital music files at your
fingertips. That's roughly the equivalent of 200 CDs!

The included PhatNoise Music Manager software helps you organize
the files any way you want so you can easily retrieve just the
tunes you want to hear. The Music Keg works with many Kenwood
changer-controlling receivers, or you can use an optional FM
controller and connect the Music Keg to any FM car stereo.

-- Endless Variety with Satellite Radio --

tune in to any one of 100 channels -- many of them
commercial-free -- from anywhere in the continental U.S, 24/7.
You get crystal-clear sound with non-stop music in every
conceivable genre, plus news, sports, talk and more. Delphi's hot
new SKYFi XM tuner works with an add-on car cassette kit as well
as home and portable kits. With SKYFi, you can use the tuner and
a single subscription to enjoy XM Satellite Radio anywhere you
go!

SUBWOOFER/SATELLITE SPEAKER SYSTEMS
-----------------------------------

It's no surprise that subwoofer/satellite home theater speaker
systems are a popular choice for folks who want to enjoy the
excitement of surround sound. Pre-matched and ready-to-go, these
packages usually feature 4 satellites for the front and surround
channels, a center channel satellite, and a powered subwoofer.
These speaker systems work together with your home theater
receiver to deliver seamless multichannel sound for movies and
music.

Subwoofer/satellite systems look sharp and integrate easily into
just about any room decor. The compact satellites can be placed on
stands or shelves, or can be mounted on the walls or ceiling. The
subwoofer can be placed in an out-of-the-way location without
sacrificing low-end performance. Most systems can be set up in
less than an hour and some even include the wiring you'll need to
make the speaker connections.

You can choose from a range of systems to fit your particular
room and budget. And, because the speakers are already optimized
to work together, you won't need to worry about matching up a lot
of gear when shopping. Here's a look at a few of our favorite
systems:

Great for smaller spaces, Polk Audio's RM6000 offers an extremely
affordable way to fill your room with rich, full home theater
sound. The satellites and center channel speaker are
video-shielded, and include built-in keyhole slots for easy wall
mounting. The 50-watt 8" subwoofer provides plenty of low-end
rumble.

The Bose Acoustimass 10 Series III pairs a powered bass module
with 5 tiny dual-cube speaker arrays. The satellites have a
versatile swiveling design that lets you rotate each speaker's
cubes for an ideal mix of direct and reflected sound that's
impressively spacious.

Pinnacle's Quantum/SubSonic system really amazed us during a
recent product demo. The satellites are made of die-cast aluminum
and are internally braced, eliminating resonance and ensuring
exceptionally clear sound. Each satellite comes with a versatile,
pivoting base that works as a pedestal or mounting bracket. The
micro-sized SubSonic subwoofer packs a pair of 6-1/2" woofers and
a 200-watt amplifier into a box that's only about an 8" cube!
