* PUBLISHERS WEEKLY, 1/6/03. "'The outlook wasn't brilliant for =
Mudville
nine that day'--but it certainly is for this robustly entertaining =
picture
book, as Payne takes a swing at Thayer's beloved poem and knocks it out =
of
the park."

* BOOKLIST, 1/1/03. "In prose set in the easy rhythms of balls and =
strikes,
Hopkinson tells the story of teenager Alta Weiss, who in 1907 pitched =
for a
semipro all-male team in Ohio. ... There's a sturdy charm to Alta's =
voice,
and an unmistakable passion for the game."

(Richard
Jackson/Atheneum, 0-689-84141-8, to be published in March. Ages 4 up)=20

happy ending that caps this tale..., most kids will recognize Minnie's
situation and be inspired by her upbeat example."

* BULLETIN, 1/03. "The book unfolds the drama slowly and suspensefully,
creating an everyday teen world that's perceptive, funny, and nuanced =
in its
own right, then shadowing that vision with the gathering darkness of =
the
impending tragedy...."

THE STEPS by Rachel Cohn (S&S, 0-689-84549-9, to be published in March. =
Ages
8 up)
* PUBLISHERS WEEKLY, 12/23/02. "Cohn does for Sydney, Australia, what =
she
did for Los Angeles and Manhattan in GINGERBREAD, while once again =
creating
a funny and feisty narrator caught in the middle of a complicated =
family
situation.... Readers will wait with bated breath for Cohn's next =
novel."
