\--------- DO YOU SET GOALS BUT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH THEM? --------/


Your daily humor:

A guy's walking along the beach in Malibu, finds a bottle, and picks it up.

A genie pops out and says, "Thanks for letting me out. For your kindness, I
will grant you one wish."

The guy says, "I've always wanted to go to Hawaii, but I can't because I'm
too afraid to fly and ships make me deathly sick from claustrophobia. So my
wish is for you to build a road from here to Hawaii."

The genie says, "I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do that. Just think of
all the work involved... think of the huge pilings we'd need to hold up the
highway, and how deep they would have to be to reach the bottom of the
ocean. And think of all the cement that would be needed. Plus, since it's
such a long span, there would have to be gas stations and rest stops along
the way. No, that is just too much to ask."

The guy says, "Well, there is one other thing I've always wanted. I'd like
to be able to understand women. What makes them laugh and cry, why they're
so temperamental, why are they so difficult to get along with... you know,
what makes them tick?"

The genie thinks a second, and says, "Would that road be two lanes or four?"
