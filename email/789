Hey Guys and Gals,

I really think you are going to like this weeks games. I was
out sick for a couple of days this week but it did not deter 
me one bit from finding great games on the net. 

I still find it hard to believe that none of you have any 
great sites for me to feature in the newsletter. I try my
best to find these great games but I know there are more 
out there that I have not seen yet.

That's fine. Be selfish and play them all by yourself. 

Game on, 
Victor

         Q-Bert or DrewBert? Either is fin by me!

Here is a wintery version of that old Atari game Q-bert. 
Instead of a freakish liooking creature with a strange nose
you are just an ordinary snowman jumping from block to block
trying to change the colors. Dont get attacked by the ice
brigade though! They are out to get you!

angles at the correct level or your history.
