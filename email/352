The Golf Swing Letter
Volume 4, Issue 2

Hi Anonymous,

Last week, we introduced some of the basic concepts of Center-Line Golf developed by Buddy Allin, 5 time winner on the PGA Tour and winner on the Senior Tour.  In particular, we talked about the key idea of TURN and TOGETHER, and the parts that must move together in order to make this happen.

This week, we will talk about the true power source in the swing...MOTION.  When you're standing, your body produces only one force; static weight, distributed through your feet and against the ground.  Put the body in motion and you produce force in another direction.  The speed of the motiion determines how much force is produced.  The hands in the set-up position produce no force except for the pressure against the handle (which can be too much).  No matter how hard the handle is squeezed, no
force is produced to move the golf ball.  But with the hands in motion a force is produced, which causes the clubhead to move, creating a force at the clubhead.  

Carrying this idea further, each swing part in motion creates force, and if these parts stay in motion and are connected throughout the swing you will apply optimum force to the golf ball.  The importance of the relationship between constant motion and force will become obvious as the different parts of the swing are discussed.  Just remember that MOTION equals FORCE.

Now you have the swing basics.  Next week you will be shown how to
incorporate each of these ideas into your swing.  You will learn to turn away together and turn through together,  maintaining connection at all times.
