1. Nolo's Estate Planning Checkup

   It's a new year -- the perfect time for taking 
   care of all those little tasks you've been putting 
   off. If "write a will" is on your list, here's 
   good news: You probably won't need a lawyer.

   But what exactly do you need? Nolo's Estate 
   Planning Checkup will help you determine how 
   wills, trusts and other planning devices can help 
   you protect your family, assets and yourself. 


Q: Do I need to make a will? 
A: Probably.

   Not everyone needs a will. If you're married, 
   don't own a lot of property and have no children, 
   everything you own would probably go to your 
   spouse at your death -- which might be fine with 
   you.
    
   But if you have children, some of your property 
   might go to them -- and if they're under 18, a 
   court would have to appoint (and supervise) an 
   adult to manage it. With a will, you can leave
   everything to your spouse, or leave property 
   directly to children but arrange for someone to 
   manage it for them. In addition, you can name a 
   personal guardian to raise your children in the 
   unlikely event something happens to you or the 
   other parent.

   If you're not married, everything would go to your 
   closest relatives, probably your parents. To leave 
   property to a partner, friend or charity, you'll 
   need a will. Find out whether you'll need a lawyer 
   to help you create one:
http://referral.nolo.com/nc.cfm?t=NB001300043882


Q: Should I name beneficiaries for bank accounts, 
   securities and IRAs? 
A: Yes. 

   Some of your most valuable assets won't pass 
   under the terms of your will. To control who 
   inherits them, all you need to do is name a 
   beneficiary, using forms provided by whoever has 
   custody of the assets now -- for example, a bank 
   or broker. It's easy and free. And after your 
   death, the funds won't have to go through probate. 
   While you're alive, you're free to change your   
   mind. Just ask your bank or broker for the form 
   you need. Find out more here:
http://referral.nolo.com/nc.cfm?t=NB001300043883


Q: Should I buy life insurance? 
A: Probably, if people depend on you for support.

   Lots of people buy too much life insurance. Do get 
   some -- term insurance is often a good buy -- if 
   you support young children or other people who 
   would need cash if you died unexpectedly. Figure  
   out what you need here:
http://referral.nolo.com/nc.cfm?t=NB001300043885


Q: Do I need to create a living trust? 
A: Maybe. 

   A basic living trust serves to avoid probate, the   
   lengthy and expensive court-supervised process of 
   distributing property after death. (Probate is 
   generally required for property left through a 
   will.)

   If you own a lot of property (which makes probate 
   more expensive), a living trust is a good idea, 
   especially if you are older or in poor health. You 
   can set up a basic living trust without a lawyer. 

   But if you don't own too much, your estate may 
   qualify for simplified probate, making a living 
   trust unnecessary. Also, property owned in joint 
   tenancy doesn't go through probate, and some 
   states have streamlined procedures to transfer 
   property to a surviving spouse. Find out whether 
   or not you need a living trust:
http://referral.nolo.com/nc.cfm?t=NB001300043886


Q: Should I name someone to make medical decisions 
   for me in case someday I can't?  
A: Yes.

   Use an advance directive (living will) to spell 
   out your wishes about end-of-life medical 
   treatment, in case someday you cannot communicate 
   your choices. Healthcare directives are especially 
   important for older folks and those in poor health 
   -- but because accidents can happen to anyone, 
   it's always smart to have one. 

   The instructions you set out in your directive 
   are, in most circumstances, binding on your 
   doctors. In some states, you can even use your 
   directive to name someone to make sure your wishes 
   are carried out. It's easy -- almost every state 
   now has a fill-in-the-blanks form -- and doesn't 
   cost a penny. It can be a godsend if family 
   members are faced with hard decisions.

   Equally important is the awkwardly named "durable 
   power of attorney for healthcare." It gives 
   someone you choose the power to make medical 
   decisions for you if you can't. Many states have 
   their own forms. Read more about healthcare 
   directives here:
http://referral.nolo.com/nc.cfm?t=NB001300043887 
 

Q: Do I need to arrange for someone to handle my 
   finances if necessary? 
A: Yes, especially if you're older or in poor health.

   It's wise to sign a "durable power of attorney for 
   finances," which gives a trusted person power over 
   your financial affairs (bills, taxes, collecting 
   Social Security and so on) if you become unable 
   to manage them. 

   Someday, if you need this kind of help but haven't 
   given someone this authority, a court will have to 
   appoint and supervise someone -- a costly, public 
   process. Figure out whether a durable power of 
   attorney makes sense for you:
http://referral.nolo.com/nc.cfm?t=NB001300043888


Q: Do I need to worry about estate tax? 
A: Probably not.

   Federal estate tax -- tax on the property you own 
   at your death -- currently affects only those who 
   leave taxable property worth more than $1 million 
   ($1.3 million if your major asset is a family 
   business) or who make large gifts (more than 
   $11,000 to any recipient during one year) before 
   death. The estate tax exemption amount is 
   scheduled to go up to $3.5 million over the next 
   few years, until the tax is repealed in 2010. 

   However, even if your estate isn't large enough to 
   owe federal estate tax, it may have to write a 
   check to your state's treasury. States get to keep   
   a share of the federal estate tax -- but as that 
   revenue dwindles, many states are starting to 
   impose their own taxes on estates that aren't 
   required to pay the IRS.

   If you do fear estate tax, there are strategies 
   that can help you postpone or avoid it. Check out 
   our Frequently Asked Questions about estate tax:

8. Lawyer Joke o' the Month 

   Two lawyers walking through the woods spotted a 
   vicious-looking bear. The first lawyer immediately 
   opened his briefcase, pulled out a pair of 
   sneakers and started putting them on.

   The second lawyer looked at him and said, "You're 
   crazy -- you'll never be able to outrun that 
   bear!"

   "I don't have to," the first lawyer replied. "I 
   only have to outrun you!"

Oh, the hilarity... the hilarity...
