It is mounted in an '03 X. The middle section of the 2nd row of seats folds down independently and it is securely strapped down.

How the heck would you mount this in the X?

Here is what I did. Bought an lcd flat monitor Digital Research, there are 
other brands available, SHARP comes to mind, ( 
http://www.dr-tech.com/products/dr-lcd15tv.asp); a mobile ac/dc Rosen dvd 
player and had the Audiovox whs200a 
(http://www.audiovox.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ExecMacro/product_mainpage.d2w/inp

ut?prrfnbr=936487) infrared headphone system installed. With this setup, the 
TV and DVD player can be removed for viewing in the house. The Audiovox 
whs200a is a dual input system. I (the driver) can listen to my preference 
(AM/FM/CD) and the rear seat passengers can listen to 2 different sources or 
the same thing I am listening to by plugging the whs200a into the factory 
rear headphone jack if they desire. The TV is powered by an inverter plugged 
into one of the power points. <snip>
