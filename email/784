END-OF-YEAR STATEMENTS FROM ENTERPRISE IRELAND AND OTHERS
- Numerous year-end reports and statements from public and
private bodies were issued over the holiday period.  One of the
most comprehensive was Enterprise Ireland's End-Of-Year
statement, which reported a net loss of just over 4,000 jobs in
firms backed by the agency over the past 12 months.  This
represents the first annual decline in ten years.  A quarter of
the job losses were in companies which closed, while the
remainder were layoffs at businesses that have continued to
trade.  Exports increased by approximately 2% to EU11.8bn,
partly due to the launch of 50 new export-oriented start-ups,
and the continuing importance of export sales is emphasised
throughout the report.  Trade with Britain by Enterprise
Ireland-backed firms remained healthy, representing 48% of
exports, while future export opportunities to Eastern Europe
are expected as EU accession proceeds.  The agency's medium
term strategy is in line with Government objectives to support
innovation and R&D, with a special focus on college-to-company
technology transfers, business incubators and community
enterprise centres.

Some of the other reports included:
. Enterprise Ireland was itself criticised, however, in a year-
end statement from the Irish Exporters Association, predicting
zero growth for next year since Irish exporters lost market
share throughout their largest markets during 2002.  The
association is calling for a new international trade policy,
claiming that Enterprise Ireland's two-year-old EurOpp scheme
has failed to assist Irish business in European markets, with
exports to Germany, for example, falling by 43% in 2002 to
EU6.7bn.

. Meanwhile data from the Central Statistics Office shows that
buoyant sales in pharmaceuticals and chemicals were entirely
responsible for the overall 2% growth in exports, which would
have declined had it not been for the strength of those
sectors.

. The Small Firms Association's end-of-year statement estimated
that 490 jobs were lost here every week during 2002, some 42%
of them in the manufacturing sector, and warned of a disastrous
2003 for Ireland's 186,000 small businesses unless urgent
action is taken to promote employment.

. A survey by the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise Association
reports a drop in confidence and widespread pessimism in the
sector, which is facing "economic uncertainty, inflationary
pressures, and out-of-control public finances".

. A review from the Office of the Director of Corporate
Enforcement, reveals that some 80 reports of indictable
offences are being submitted by auditors every month.  The
number is expected to double in 2003.

. Figures from the credit data agency Experian Ireland put the
total number of liquidations for the year at 379, a drop of 11%
on 2001.  Receiverships rose from 17 to 33 and examinerships
from 12 to 16.  Worst hit were the construction, technology,
and printing industries.

. A statement from the Society of the Irish Motor Industry
indicating that the anticipated drop in new car sales for 2002
came in at 5%, a somewhat smaller decline than expected.

. The final figures for work-related fatalities, showing that 57
people died in occupational accidents in 2002, seven less than
in 2001, mostly in agriculture and construction.

. The December statistics from the NCB's Purchasing Managers'
Index showing that manufacturing activity was down for the
third consecutive month, at 49.1, while employment in the
sector fell for the fourth month in a row.

. A survey from the European Foundation for the Improvement of
Living and Working Conditions, suggesting that Irish workers
put in more hours than any other European workforce.
Apparently 29% of Irish employees put in more than 45 hours
weekly, compared to a European average of 20%.  Some 11% of us
exceed 60 hours work in a week.

IDA SUGGESTS JOB LOSS IS SLOWING, HOPE FOR Q1 2003
- IDA Ireland's end-of-year statement, like Enterprise Ireland's,
showed a net loss in jobs at companies assisted by the agency,
with 11,713 jobs created against almost 15,000 lost.  The most
fertile sectors for new jobs were pharmaceuticals and
healthcare, where employment grew by 3.8%, followed by
international and financial services.  Textile and clothing
companies were the worst-hit sectors, while the information
technology sector experienced a 5% fall.  Average employment
shrinkage was 2.2%, but the rate at which jobs are being lost
is slowing.  Looking forward to 2003, IDA Ireland's chief
executive Sean Dorgan spoke of brighter indications ahead,
citing healthcare and financial services expansions throughout
the country, and the first stirrings of a pick-up in certain
specialised IT and semiconductor markets.  He also predicted
that the first quarter of this year would be the best since
2000 for new investments, with several major new projects due
to commence, employing up to 8,700 people in the coming years.
In 2002, IDA Ireland paid a total of EU116m in grants. Full
report at: http://www.ida.ie/news/showRelease.asp?storyid=177

AURIUM SOFTWARE TO EMPLOY 16 OVER TWO YEARS
- An Irish-based company founded by context-aware software
specialists from Trinity College and the University of
Strathclyde has announced that it expects to employ 16 people
over the next two years.  Aurium Software has recently raised
EU730k from HotOrigin and private investment schemes and
intends to target the global travel sector initially, with its
En Route flagship product.  According to co-founder Dr Simon
Dobson, Aurium's eventual goal is "to be the recognised global
leader in context enhancement software".  Dr Dobson is a former
assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science of
Trinity College Dublin. The other co-founders are Richard
Greenane, formerly with the Department's Computer Vision and
Robotics Group, and Professor Paddy Nixon who holds a chair of
Computer Science at the University of Strathclyde. Related

ARTESYN CLOSURE IN YOUGHAL TO COST 160 JOBS
- In a shock pre-Christmas announcement, Artesyn Technologies
revealed that it will close its power supply manufacturing
facility in Youghal, Co. Cork, by September of this year as
part of a global restructuring programme aimed at saving $35m
annually.  Some 160 people will lose their jobs and production
will be moved to Hungary and China.  Artesyn employs about
4,700 people worldwide but expects to lay off about 400 this
year.  Tanaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and
Employment Mary Harney described the closure as "a shocking
blow to the workers and their families, particularly at this
time of the year", and called for urgent efforts from the
development agencies to identify alternative investments for
the area and minimise the impact of the job losses. The company
will retain its design engineering and sales operation, which
employs 82 people in Youghal.

SURPLUS IN PUBLIC FINANCES AS 2002 ENDS
- To the surprise of many, the public finances ended 2002 with a
minor surplus of EU95m, a mere three months after the
Department of Finance suggested that it would be necessary to
borrow EU750m to achieve spending targets for the year.  The
turnaround in the end-of-year figures was attributed to a last-
minute increase in tax receipts, savings in servicing the
national debt and in general public expenditure, revenues from
the Central Bank and National Lottery, and the postponement of
the first set of benchmarking payments.  Savings in various
government departments also contributed to the bottom line.
The Government is not amending its position on the general
economic outlook for 2003, however, and has expressed
particular concern at the continuing drop in tax revenues,
which fell 3% in 2002 despite a budgeted rise of 1.1%.

PETER SUTHERLAND LEAVES GOLDMAN SACHS
- The former Attorney General and European Commissioner Peter
Sutherland retired as managing director of Goldman Sachs on
January 1.  It's understood he intends to pursue other
interests, following a colourful career and a profitable seven
years with the investment bank, including an estimated EU140m
windfall from a flotation in 1998. Mr Sutherland has in his
time served as chairman of GATT and AIB Group.

GALWAY-BASED SOFTWARE COMPANY AND DATA IRELAND MOVES TO INDIA
- AND Data Ireland is to relocate its Irish operation to India in
order to reduce costs.  The Galway-based subsidiary of a Dutch
parent closed in December with the loss of 28 jobs, having
employed 100 people one year ago.  IDA Ireland will lose its
EU1m investment in the company, and it's understood that over
EU6m is owed in total to various creditors.  The company's
business was in the collation and processing of address and
route information, and the provision of geographical and
mapping software.

NEW E-BUSINESS PARK IN SHANNON GETS GO-AHEAD
- Planning permission has been granted for the Westpark e-
business park in Shannon after a two-year application process.
Limerick-based Concre Development Ltd expects to spend EU150m
building seven separate five-storey blocks, including a data
centre.  The project will employ 250 people during construction
and will provide for up to 1,500 jobs when complete.

ELAN'S SHARE PRICE BOOSTED BY INDEPENDENT TESTING OF MS DRUG
- Shares in Elan surged on the New York Stock Exchange over the
holiday period, following the publication in a US medical
journal of positive test results on its multiple sclerosis drug
Antegren.  Goodbody Stockbrokers are now predicting that the
drug could be on the market in late 2004, a year earlier than
predicted, potentially accelerating the pharmaceutical giant's
financial recovery.  Related website: http://www.elan.com

RAPID TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS A 40% FALL IN ANNUAL LOSSES
- The Dublin-based computer keyboard manufacturer Rapid
Technologies reported losses of EU1.75m for the year ending
June 30, 2002, a 40% improvement compared to the previous year.
A 5% decrease in operating costs and a major US customer
acquisition were crucial in the reduction of losses, according
to chairman Pat McDonagh, who also founded e-learning firm
Riverdeep.  Rapid Technologies, which is listed on Dublin's
Developing Companies' Market and London's Alternative
Investment Market, intends to diversify beyond keyboard
technology in 2003.

ParthusCeva SHARES HIT BY NEWS OF SLOW SALES
- Shares in the Dublin-based technology company ParthusCeva
dropped again this week, this time by 15%, recovering slightly
to 13% following the revelation that fourth-quarter sales will
come in well below forecasts.  A net loss of up to $25.2m for
the quarter is now expected.  Chief executive Kevin Fielding
explained that the company has "experienced delays in licensing
decisions on several significant deals", but insisted that the
"overall sales pipeline has not materially diminished".

CREATIVE DIGITAL MEDIA EXHIBITION OPENS IN DIGITAL HUB
- The Digital Hub in Dublin has announced details of its first
exhibition showcasing the creative potential of digital
technology.  Exhibit 1, as the project is called, will provide
an outlet for the work of 16 new and established artists at its
Project Office in Thomas Street from January 6 to March 3.
Disciplines on show will include fine art, CGI, interactive
media, web art, linear and interactive films, animation, music,
sound, graphic design, fashion, motion graphics, commercial
production, gaming, mobile phone technologies, web development
and computer programming.  Viewing is by appointment through
Sorcha Ni Dhonnchu at +353-1-4085424 or
mailto:exhibit@thedigitalhub.com.

FIRST IRISH-BASED PRESIDENT ADDRESSES ICSA BANQUET IN LONDON
- Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine
and Natural Resources John Browne was guest of honour at the
recent centenary banquet of the Institute of Chartered
Secretaries and Administrators (ICSA), in London's Guildhall.
Christopher Kane, the first Irish-based president in the
association's 100-year history, welcomed over 300 guests from
all over the world to the gala event, before the Minister spoke
on the role of company secretaries in effective corporate
governance.  Mr Kane, who is also Bord Failte's Director of
Marketing, later enlarged upon this theme, contrasting the
Irish and British policies on compliance and calling for the
role of the company secretary to be enhanced.

CONNECT RAISES EU432,500 IN BUSINESS EXPANSION SCHEME
- The Software Globalisation services company Connect Global
Services has successfully completed a Business Expansion Scheme
funding round which raised EU432,500.  Commenting on the fact
that the BES was oversubscribed, executive chairman Michael
Keane said that the company "has a strong record of revenue and
profit growth which has continued through the current year",
and he expects to double revenues this financial year.  He also
supported the Irish Software Association's call for the limit
on BES funding to be increased from its current maximum of
EU750,000 to at least EU1,500,000.  Connect was founded in 1998
and has offices in Dublin and Palo Alto, California.  Related

MASSANA UNVEILS DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT KITS
- Dublin-headquartered technology company Massana has announced
the availability of complete reference designs and development
kits based on its Everest family of gigabit ethernet
transceivers.  Massana uses proprietary methodologies and
custom signal processing architectures to provide customers
with broadband capabilities for wired and wireless Internet
bandwidth.  CEO Paul Costigan remarked that the company expects
the market for gigabit ethernet to "really take off in 2003".

PRE-TAX PROFITS UP 2.5% AT JURYS DOYLE
- The Jurys Doyle hotel group returned to profit growth in the
six months ending October 31, with a 2.5% increase in pre-tax
profits to EU29.5m, meeting market expectations.  Chief
executive Pat McCann expressed cautious optimism on foot of the
strong results, which were attributed to the continued strength
of the Jurys Inns brand, recovery in the US side of the
business and healthy performance in the group's London
properties.  When an exceptional profit of EU1.08m from the
disposal of the Jurys Skylon and Waterford three-star hotels is
included, the profits were up by 6% to EU30.6m.  Occupancy
rates rose by 6.6% during the period, while the average room
rate was down 1% to EU93.  Jurys Doyle operates 30 hotels in
Ireland, Britain and the US, and currently has six new
properties planned for construction, including a 253-room Inn
on Dublin's Parnell Street.

ComReg COMPELS EIRCOM TO ENABLE FLAT-RATE INTERNET ACCESS
- Flat-rate Internet access may finally arrive in Ireland,
following a directive from the Commission for Communications
Regulation that Eircom must offer a wholesale flat-rate access
product to its rivals, within a timetable that will allow them
to introduce a retail product by June 27.  Eircom has
previously failed to facilitate other service providers with
flat-rate access to its network, provoking criticism and
lobbying from parties such as the interest group IrelandOffLine
and rivals like Esat BT, both of whom have welcomed this week's
announcement.  The former state telecommunications company also
resisted calls to introduce flat-rate access itself, insisting
that it would not make economic sense, but Minister for
Communications Dermot Ahern has been active in recent months in
pushing for the service, saying that it will promote
competition, contribute to the Irish telecoms market, and
improve overall Internet usage here.  At least eight other EU
countries have flat-rate Internet access, and it's generally
seen as crucial to the modern business sector.

DEPARTMENT OF ENTERPRISE ANNOUNCES SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
STRATEGY
- Tanaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment Mary
Harney announced her department's first Sustainable Development
Strategy this week, the first from any government department.
Explaining that sustainable development means integrating
economic, environmental and social dimensions in a balanced
way, Ms Harney spoke of "finding more environmentally and
socially responsible and sustainable ways of doing business,
both within the Department itself and for enterprises in
Ireland".  Over the next three years the areas of climate
change, competitive sustainability, corporate social
responsibility and departmental sustainability will be
prioritised.  The strategy is available on the department's
website at http://www.entemp.ie/whats.htm

UTV PURCHASES DUBLIN RADIO STATION LITE FM
- Just before Christmas, Belfast-based UTV acquired the Dublin
radio station Lite FM for a reported EU14m, in a move which
values the broadcaster at six times turnover and emphasises
UTV's determination to enter the radio market in the capital.
This follows a failed UTV bid to purchase Dublin's FM104 in
October, which was blocked by the Broadcasting Commission of
Ireland.  In the last two years UTV has also acquired
Limerick's Live95 FM and Cork's County Media radio stations.
UTV will assume responsibility for Lite FM's EU1.3m in debts,
but it's understood that the station is close to breaking even,
having achieved a 12% share of Dublin's over-35 listenership
since its launch in May 2000.  A number of Lite FM executives
and shareholders will receive major windfalls from the sale.

EU CERTIFICATION FOR VOICEVAULT'S SPEECH IDENTITY SYSTEMS
- Technology from the Dublin-based VoiceVault (formerly trading
as Buytel) has become the first company to be certified by the
European Union for electronic signatures, making it legally
possible for users to authenticate their identity by speech.  A
major contract with a large US insurance firm will see the
technology being rolled out to over eight million users in a
deal which will help VoiceVault to break even in the next six
months, according to co-founder and chief technology office
Vance Harris.  Despite a difficult 2002, the company is
currently raising funding from new and existing investors, and
predicts strong take-up for its technology from the banking and
financial services sectors. Related website:

EIRCOM'S PRICES AND SERVICES UNDER FIRE IN WDC REPORT
- The latest telecommunications report from the Western
Development Commission details complaints against Eircom and
other Irish telcos over alleged exorbitant prices and poor
services in the western regions.  Firms such as Lionbridge
Technologies, E-Training International and CMS Peripherals
claim that telecoms services are five times more expensive in
Clare and Mayo, where they have operations, than in the US, and
that the facilities which are available are insufficient and
unreliable.  The shipping and weather information company
Nowcasting had to move from Clare to Dublin as its service was
undependable due to the poor underlying telecoms
infrastructure.  Other companies claim that they are unable to
expand in the west due to the crippling costs of services.

TerminalFour ANNOUNCES NEW BUSINESS AND FUNDING PLANS
- The Dublin-based content management software company
TerminalFour has released details of 15 significant contract
wins in the past three months, ranging from EU20k to over
EU100k, including a major tender for Queen's University Belfast
which attracted 27 other bidders.  Other new customers include
Jefferson Smurfit, the IDA, three Health Boards and a number of
major British companies.  TerminalFour currently employs 20
people between Dublin and England and expects to attract
significant funding in 2003, having raised EU320k through a
business expansion scheme in 2002. Related website:

MAJOR DUTCH E-GOVERNMENT CONTRACT FOR BALTIMORE TECHNOLOGIES
- Baltimore Technologies has been selected to provide the digital
certificate security for the Dutch eGovernment initiative.
This will be based on the e-security company's UniCERT Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) software.  Baltimore has already
provided secure services such as e-tax, e-identity, e-police
and secure communications for government organisations
worldwide, including Italy's Ministry of the Interior and
Ministry of Finance, Britain's Ministry of Defence, Norwegian
Defence, Irish Revenue and the Government of Valencia, Spain.

AMT ANNOUNCES MAJOR PARTNERSHIP WITH FUTURA AIRLINE
- The Dublin-based aviation systems company Aircraft Management
Technologies (AMT) announced that its flagship product,
FlightMan, will be implemented across the Spanish holiday
airline Futura's fleet of planes.  Flightman assists airlines
in satisfying regulatory requirements and improving flight
safety and security by helping pilots, crew and engineers to
capture and utilise operational information more efficiently.

XIAM PROVIDES TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AT CHARLES STREET
COMMUNICATIONS
- Mobile messaging technology from Dublin-based XIAM has been
deployed at Charles Street Communications, where it is at the
heart of various IT and messaging services to clients of the
business service provider.  XIAM's Information Router enables
Charles Street Communications to offer key market-leading
services in mobile messaging applications, according to CEO
Colm Healy.  The company was founded in 1999 and has over 200
customers worldwide.  Related websites: http://www.xiam.com and
http://www.charles-st.com

NewBay TO OFFER "BLOGGING" SOFTWARE TO MOBILE PHONE USERS
- New Irish start-up NewBay Software will bring weblogging to
mobile phones with the launch of its FoneBlog product to
telecoms operators later this month.  Chief executive Paddy
Holahan, who was formerly vice president of marketing at
Baltimore Technologies, explained that operators can rebrand
and sell the service to their customers, who will then be able
to update their personal weblogs through either Short
Messaging Service (SMS) texts or MMS (Multi-Media Messaging)
images, without the use of a computer.  Weblogs or 'blogs' are
personal online records of items of interest to their creator,
and have become one of the most popular Internet publishing
models over the past two years.  Related website:

GALEN SHARES THREATENED BY POSSIBLE PATENT BATTLE
- Northern pharmaceutical group Galen saw its shares fall this
week over fears of a possible patent battle.  This involves its
recently-purchased pre-menstrual drug Sarafem, which is
threatened by rival Teva Pharmaceuticals' plan to release a
similar generic version.  Galen said that it believes it will
be able to conduct a "fairly robust" defence of the product,
which was purchased from Eli Lilly last month and is protected
by patent until 2005.  The group estimates that such a legal
action will cost between $1m and $2m over three years.  It has
been suggested that the drop of over 10% in Galen's Dublin and
London share prices was caused by investor panic and over-
reaction.  Related website: http://www.galen.co.uk

NATIONAL PENSION FUND SUFFERED LOSSES OF SOME EU763M IN 2002
- The National Pension Reserve Fund, which will fund state and
old age pensions from the year 2025, lost some EU763m during
2002, due to the continuing decline of global stocks.  The
fund, which is 80% in equities and 20% in bonds, now stands at
approximately EU7.4bn.  A report in the Sunday Business Post
claimed that some EU50m was lost on Nokia shares alone, which
halved in value since early 2002.

PRUDENTIAL'S DUBLIN OPERATION ACQUIRED BY CANADA LIFE
- Canada Life will acquire Prudential Europe Management Services,
the Dublin subsidiary of Prudential plc, as soon as High Court
approval is forthcoming, as part of a EU129m deal which also
includes some of Prudential's German interests.  The Irish

INTERNATIONAL REPORT SAYS IRISH BANKS ARE STABLE AND PROFITABLE
- The international ratings agency Moody's has issued a positive
outlook for Irish banks, observing that their position amongst
Europe's most stable is likely to continue for the future.
This is based on the strong financial fundamentals of the banks
and the economy, despite ongoing problems, and the fact that
our recently-reduced growth levels are still among the highest
in Europe.  Moody's senior analyst and vice president Elisabeth
Rudman commented that "current levels of profitability appear
sustainable", unless further global economic troubles impact on
the Irish economy.

IRELAND THE MOST GLOBALISED COUNTRY, THANKS TO EXPORTS
- Ireland has been ranked the "most globalised" of 62 countries
for the second year running, in the annual AT Kearney/Foreign
Policy magazine survey.  The survey is based on measures of
global political engagement, technology, economic integration,
and personal international contact; Ireland's top placing was
due primarily to our high level of trade and multinational
investment, along with significant worldwide telephone traffic.
The export-driven basis of our economy was one of our strongest
areas, while our take-up of Internet technologies and global
interconnectedness was one of the weakest.  The survey relates
to research and data from the year 2001, but it's thought that
the key factors contributing to our performance were largely
unaffected by the downturn of 2002.

QUB RESEARCH TEAM'S PROGRESS IN COMBATING BREAST CANCER
- A research team at Queen's University Belfast is attempting to
define the function of a gene known as BRCA1, which guards the
body against cancerous cells, in a study of the incidence of
breast cancer.  Led by Dr Paul Harkin, the team is working to
understand how defects in the gene, which is known to play a
role in repairing damaged DNA, can prevent it from identifying
and destroying cancerous cells.  By replacing BRCA1 into cancer
cells, the team is hoping to reactivate its ability to destroy
cancer cells which have been exposed to the molecule interferon
gamma.
