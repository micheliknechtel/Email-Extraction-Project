Week 6: Keeping the Connection for Good
Welcome to Week 6 of the Awaken Your Sexual Self online course. I hope you are proud of yourself for all the work you have done and the progress you have made. Whether you have been able to see the direct results of your work yet or not, just taking the time to focus on yourself for the last five weeks is definitely a step in the right direction. You've been laying the groundwork for a new way of thinking about yourself as a sensual, sexual being. This final week will prepare you to step outside of this course and into the new sexual landscape you've created for yourself. 

I have been a sexologist for over two decades, and there is one important part of sex and sexual desire that I've seen ignored again and again -- sexual spirit. And yet, a woman's sexual spirit (her inner sexual self) is often the crucial missing ingredient for a satisfying sex life. Owning and embracing your sexual spirit will help you use everything you learned in this course in your everyday life. This week you're going to do an important activity that will help you embrace your sexual spirit. You'll also learn how to begin to control the chaos in your life, so that your sexual desire can truly flourish.

Remember that you have four extra weeks of access to the course materials. So if you've fallen behind or want to reread any of the lectures or repeat any exercises, you can. You will continue to receive weekly emails, with tips and other useful information.


Weekly Tip
To keep the progress going after this course ends, be sure to continue writing in your journal. Try to write something every day about how you are feeling or what you experienced that day that made you think about your sexuality. Read more tips here.
