Welcome to another issue of College-Talk, brought to you by the 
developers of three college admissions and scholarships websites:
<http://www.college-scholarships.com>

---------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------

STATE COLLEGE SAVINGS PLANS FACE TROUBLE: Because of the current
stock market slump and recent tuition increases, some of the state
prepaid tuition plans do not now appear to be a good investment.
If you have money in such a plan, or have been considering one, do
your homework and be sure you're making a good choice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW SURVEY DATA ON STUDENTS WORKING: Now, there is additional
survey data indicating that students working more than 20 hours a
week greatly increase the risk they will "stop out" or "drop out"
before earning a degree.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
WE'VE ADDED A NEW PAGE ON OUR WEBSITE: If you're interested in
earning a degree via the internet, we now list some options for you
at <http://www.college-scholarships.com/ssac.htm>.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

OUT-OF-STATE TUITION WAIVERS: First time freshmen with a high school
GPA of at least 2.5, ACT math and English scores of 19 or more, and
an ACT composite of 23 or more (or equivalent SAT scores), and
transfer students with at least 12 credits and a 2.75 or higher GPA
now qualify for out-of-state tuition ($1,300 per semester) at
University of Louisiana at Lafayette. For information, visit
<http://www.louisiana.edu> or email <scholar@louisiana.edu>. Those
with a 26 ACT or higher (or equivalent SAT's) qualify for UL's
Honors Program.
