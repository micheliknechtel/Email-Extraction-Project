*~*~*~*~*------ A WORD FROM THE KITCHEN ------*~*~*~*~*~*

As I was taking about spices yesterday one of my favorite
blends (and Hubby's too) is the Cajun style seasoning. This
is generally a blend of salt and a variety of spices like
cayenne (red) pepper, black pepper, onion powder, garlic
powder, chili powder, thyme, basil, and bay leaf or even
nutmeg and parsley flakes. The combos are endless and there
are even salt-free versions. He actually likes to sprinkle
this on potatoes, fried foods, vegetables and even eggs too.
A very simple recipe for enjoying a punch of flavor and not
a lot of fat is baking some CAJUN CHICKEN. The grill is great
too but some of us once it gets a little snowy out don't want
to go through the hassle of digging out the grill. Here is a
light and simple recipe for CAJUN CHICKEN using your favorite
prepared Cajun seasoning. I like to try all different types
and will be using my new Spice House seasoning on this but
you can even check out Marzee's Corner below to make your own!

Enjoy!
