<i>Last telesales trainer Art Sobczak explained how to weed out and prioritize a large number of prospects so you can exp=
end your energy on those who are ready to buy now while keeping in touch with those who will buy later.  This week, he'll=
 explain how to keep in contact with the lower priority prospects with your own personal marketing plan.</i>

<p>Situations in companies change every day. (Just think about the changes at your company in just the past three months!=
) If changes involved new needs and requirements, prospects will likely turn to what is familiar. And when you're in touc=
h with them, you could be at the forefront of their mind when a new need develops. Plus, through repetitiveness, you buil=
d credibility in their mind. The more they see your name, the more familiar and credible it becomes. Especially when they=
 associate you with problems you can solve and value you can deliver.

<p>Therefore I suggest that you have a planned marketing program to complement your phone calls as a way to stay in touch=
 with these groups of prospects (By the way, you could and should include your regular customers in this plan). Here's a =
specific plan and process for your own personal marketing strategy.
<ol>
<li><STRONG>Define your categories.</STRONG>   Determine who you will discard, and who you'll place into your system. For=
 example, anyone now spending over a certain dollar level with a competitor could be a category. Or people with a project=
 planned over two years in the future.

<li><STRONG>Automate your follow-up.</STRONG>   Contact management programs make this a snap for you. Otherwise, it could=
 be a nightmare, and would take away from your selling time. With the investment in high-powered computers, peripherals, =
and contact management software so relatively low compared to the return, it's just plain negligent to not be computerize=
d if you're at all serious about selling.

<li><STRONG>Plan and execute your 
              communications.</STRONG>     Decide how you'll communicate with your prospects, and how often. Certainly yo=
ur company's catalog and sale brochures are possibilities-- but that's the norm. Boring. It's better than nothing, but it=
 lumps you in with every other vendor. You want to be perceived as someone special ... someone who adds value. You want t=
hem to think of you first. To do that you need to reach them at a personal level. Here are some ideas:
<ul>
<li>Newsletters, special reports, or other information that provide useful content, with a subtle underlying sell message=
. Consider putting together a brief newsletter that provides valuable information they can use, not just puffery about yo=
ur company and products. For example, include tips and tidbits that can help them in their jobs. Of course the suggestion=
s should include the use of your product or service, but that's not the main reason for the communication. For example, a=
 supplier of packaging products could send out a piece on "Ten Ways to Reduce Your Shipping Expenses." You're perceived l=
ess as a me-too vendor, and more as someone who solves the problems they deal with. By the way, you could send these via =
mail, fax, or email.

<li>Post cards. We all trash unopened direct mail. When was the last time, though, you didn't at least skim the message o=
n a postcard? At an investment of less than 50 cents each including postage, postcards printed with your message are an i=
nexpensive way to get in front of customers and prospects. 

<li>Articles you clip that would be of interest. Everything you read should flow through your "Who else would be interest=
ed in this?"-filter.

<li>Free samples of your product. We all love getting packages, don't we?

<li>Fax broadcasts (relatively easy out of most contact management computer programs). Again, make sure it presents value=
, and not just a blatant advertising message.

<li>Handwritten notes. Takes more time, but if you commit to just a few of these per week to your very best prospects, th=
e rewards could be well worth it. I'm often asked about using stationery with reps' photos. Personally, I like them. It's=
 easier to connect with a person when you know what she looks like. You don't photograph well, you say? I've seen reps wh=
o have caricatures drawn and printed on their personalized note cards. It's different and fun.

<li>Birthday cards.

<li>Other holiday cards, or even cards for no particular reason. Speaker and trainer Andrea Nierenberg suggests dropping =
a personalized postcard in the mail. While your company's stationery is adequate for regular thank you notes, a hand-pick=
ed postcard with a design or topic of interest to the customer speaks volumes. When you're traveling for pleasure or busi=
ness, scan the touristy post card racks with specific prospects and customers in mind.

<li>Special items for very select 
                prospects. I've sent books to prospects on topics unrelated to 
                what I sell, but what I knew they were interested in. Find out 
                what your prospects' and customers' passions are, and believe 
                me, that transcends business. I'm a golf fanatic, and I've even 
                listened to bad salespeople who sent me golf-related stuff.</li>                                         =
               
</ul> 
<li><STRONG>Call with a purpose.</STRONG> 
              Please, I beg you, DO NOT call prospects and customers and use any 
              of the following:</li>                     
</ol>
<p><i>"Calling to check in with you and see how it's going . . ."
<br>"Wanted to touch base and see if anything's changed . . ."
<br>"Hadn't talked in a while and thought I just give you a call . . ."
<br>"Just wanted to call and see if you're ready to do something now . . ."
<br>"Was wondering if there was anything you needed . . ."</i>

<p>These are nuisance calls.  Sales reps who open calls with these inane phrases are lazy, or simply don't know what to s=
ay. The first I can't help with; the latter ... well, let's get to it.
Make a personal commitment to have a value-added reason for calling, every time you phone. Value-added means that the per=
son can say they gained something by taking your call. And don't even think about whining that you can't come up with som=
ething new every time you call. 

<p>Brainstorm with other reps for value-added reasons for calling. Think of industry or product news they might find inte=
resting. Let them know of sales or promotions that apply specifically to them, based on what you know about them. If you'=
ve had policy changes at your company that would make doing business with you more attractive, call for that reason. Have=
 a meeting with all of your fellow reps and have a team competition, with prizes, for the most value-added reasons for ca=
lling. They must fit into this opening statement: "Mr. Prospect, the reason for the call is that I have some information =
I felt you'd be interested in. It's (value-added reason)."

<p>Here are a few other phrases you could use: 
            <P><EM>"I saw some interesting news the other day and thought you'd like 
            to hear about it . . . ."
            <br>"I was thinking about you . . ."
<br>"When I saw the new service we just introduced, you were the first person that came to mind as someone who really cou=
ld save some money with it . . ."
<br>"Wanted to be sure you're familiar with some 
            new developments in the industry that might have an effect on you . 
            . ."</EM></I> </P>

<p>Bottom line, when your call comes in, you want them to think, "Oh, that's Pat with ABC Company. Every time he calls he=
 has some good information for me," as opposed to, "Oh, it's that salesperson again. Tell him I'm busy."

<p>Be selective about who you follow up with, have something valuable to say every time you call, and have a planned syst=
em for staying in contact with them complements your calls, and you'll find more of your longer-term follow-ups buying in=
 the short term.
