<b>Convert Vinyl LPs to CD</b> Converting audio taken from LPs and cassettes is a time intensive process. First, you have to capture the audio in real time, followed by a somewhat complicated editing process. Through the use of this ebook, the process should be simplified, although there is no true cookie-cutter model for editing audio. If your goal is the preservation of vinyl, your time spent will be well worth the investment and the more LPs you record, the easier the process will become.

My, how times have changed. After a nice 22-ounce ribeye from the
<a href="http://www.acmechophouse.com/">Acme Chop House</a>, we've each retired
to our respective computers: Jake on his now-antiquated iBook; Lori on her
lightweight Windows 2000 laptop; Gretchen on Oogie Boogie; Me on Zero; and
Sprocket on his rawhide. That's not really a computer, but he's workin' on
it pretty intensely. In between meeting madness, we've been sucking down
sushi with <a href="http://www.business2.com/whatsnext">famous writers</a>,
consuming caffeinated beverages en masse, and driving all over town for a
replacement power adapter. Tomorrow, we'll hit the Moscone Center to take on
Apple's entourage. Boy, they made quite a few announcements today! I think
I've persuaded my team to take the iMac home with them so that I might be
able to purchase the forthcoming 17" PowerBook. It's a geek's dream come
true - and an upgrade in every respect. <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> is shaping up to be one sweet
browser - completely destroying the competition with its first public
release. The code is actually based on KHTML, and it handles pages
infinitely better than Mozilla or IE (on OS X, obviously). I'd love for 'em
to port it to Windows, but that probably won't happen. They did it for
QuickTime, but that was out of necessity. Not that I'm all that impressed
with that particular translation, but it's the thought that counts.


<p>

Fonts are fun. You can make 'em, too - if you use the right software. Your
Handwriting 2.0 is cheap, and the results prove it: crude, and
barely usable. I recommend using ScanFont from <A HREF="http://www.fontlab.com/">FontLab.com</A>. If you want it to
look even better on more than one platform, get their full-
featured product. I don't have the time or patience to fontify
everybody's complete manuscript, and I'm sure you don't have $200+
lying around to spend on software you may use only once or twice.
Here's my proposal: I could put your signature, SIMPLE logo, or
something of the like into TrueType AND OpenType fonts. Heck, I
could even do dingbats (pictures) on a case-by-case basis. If it's
a complicated graphic, assume I can't do it. What I first need is clean,
clear, high-quality, pure black &amp; white scans of the
glyphs you want to immortalize. $10 doesn't sound too unreasonable at this
point (for your signature or a single logo). You could do it yourself
- but will you? Well, I thought I'd offer. If you're
interested, send the graphic(s) to the e-mail alias: font @ lockergnome.com.
Then, after I tell you that I can do what you want me to do, use
the same 'font' e-mail address at PayPal.com to complete the
transaction. Other arrangements can be made.

<p>

What else is out? The new <a href="http://www.windowsmedia.com/9series/download/download.asp">Windows Media Player</a>. So far, I really like it.
Sean Alexander (a Microsoft product manager) and I have been exchanging
e-mails for a few weeks now. He recently expounded on their new HighMAT
format: "It's a little different from VCD. HighMAT is designed to solve the
following problems: 'I have a new DVD player that plays my MP3 and WMA discs but it takes
too long to load my music &amp; playlists, doesn't do a good job of
finding / displaying artist / album information, and the on-screen menu of
my music is hard to navigate; or 'I want to burn a cheap disc that has all my home movies and pictures
from 2002, organized cleanly so I can view them quickly'
HighMAT is really just way of structuring data on today's existing
CD/DVD discs for playback of today's existing formats (MP3, WMA, WMV,
JPG, etc).  Burn a HighMAT Disc w/ MM2 or WM Player 9 Series and
you'll see it's 100% compatible with the existing data formats. The
difference is an index file and folder structure. When it's played back
in a DVD Player that supports HighMAT, you'll get a 'better together'
experience - faster loading, richer metadata and on-screen handling of
multiple types of data (Photos, Music, Video) - all on the same disc. And
it's codec / format agnostic." Definitely sounds like a winner to me.

<P>

{Instant messenger} MSN, AIM, and Y! instant messenger (IM)
programs have another IM competitor in ChatAbles. If you need more
than smiley faces, icons, or graphics that come with your IM
program, ChatAbles offers collections of famous people and Pepsi
Blue characters (obviously, they're partners in this endeavor)
that talk. ChatAbles labels itself "Instant message with more
attitude!" This program, I believe, is aimed at the pre-teen and

<p>

Vallen Jpegger is a handy image viewer program that has been
especially designed for browsing through large folders with many
images. About 40 different image formats are supported, such as
JPG, BMP, PCX, TIF, PNG, GIF, and many more. Original Explorer
context menus provide all necessary file management functions like
Copy, Move, and Delete. Thumbnails of all images in the current
directory are created automatically, and full scalable print
support (including print preview) for images and thumbnails is
also included, as well as a slide show mode. Images can be
mirrored, rotated and saved. A built-in sound interface allows you
to play back MP3, MIDI, or WAV files while viewing. It can be used
to assign spoken commentaries or sound impressions to specific
folders. Besides viewing images and slide shows, you can also use
Jpegger to take quick screenshots of your Windows Desktop or
applications and find duplicate images. The application also
includes a full-featured MP3 Sound Explorer. [MWA] <p> <br>

<b>Balthisar Cascade 2.0 beta 12 [1.4M] W9x/2k/XP FREE</b>

Balthisar Cascade is intended for the creation of specification 2
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS2) for inclusion into HTML documents.
Balthisar Cascade includes most of the features an amateur or
professional HTML developer needs to create publishable hypertext
documents. It follows the CSS2 specification as set forth by the
World Wide Web Consortium. Cascade currently supports CSS2
strictly; i.e., it does not support proprietary extensions to CSS
as used in Microsoft Internet Explorer, and it does not support
JavaScript style sheets at all. Some of Balthisar Cascade's
features include Creation of Classes, Creation of Subclasses,
Creation of Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements, the ability to
export data as an HTML file or a CSS2 file... and many more. [MWA]

<b>Question:</b> Is there a way to preset what folder Windows
Explorer (not IE) opens up to (e.g., "My Documents")? <P>

<b>Answer:</b> This solution applies to Win2k/XP. If you want
Windows Explorer to open to the folder C:\My Documents, right-
click the Windows Explorer shortcut that you use to run the
program and choose "Properties." At the Windows Explorer
Properties dialog box, click the Shortcut tab. Click in the Target
entry box, and then press End. Add to the end of the existing line
"/e, c:\My Documents". The complete line in the Target entry box
should now be <P>

%SystemRoot%\explorer.exe /e, c:\My Documents
<P>

The /e switch tells Windows Explorer to open in the two-pane
Explorer mode and the c:\ tells it to open in folder C:\. If you
wish to have Explorer open the C:\ drive, leave off "My
Documents." If you omit the /e switch, Windows Explorer opens in a
single-pane view. <P>

Here's the solution for Win9x (and possibly ME): Find the shortcut
in the Windows Start Menu and change the properties from
"C:\WINDOWS\EXPLORER.EXE /n,/e,C:\" to "C:\WINDOWS\EXPLORER.EXE
/n,/e,C:\foldername". To open to the "My Documents" folder, use:
"C:\Windows\Explorer.exe /n, /e, ::{450d8fba-ad25-11d0-98a8-0800361b1103}" <P>

The meaning of the command line switches are as follows:
<ul>
<li>/n - Always open a new window (even if the specified folder is already open).
<li>/e - Use Windows Explorer view.
</ul>

The default (with no switch) is Open view.  [Meryl]

<b>Question:</b> Mom let one of the grandkids mess around in
Microsoft Word 2000 and now there is garbage in the default New
Document template. How do I get back to a clean New Document
template? <P>

<b>Answer:</b> Wow! Isn't it funny what kids can get into? Don't
worry, this is an easy problem to fix. First, let me explain that
all document templates are saved as a DOT file. The New Document
template is the normal.dot file on your computer. Some people
would say that to fix your problem, you should delete the
normal.dot file because Microsoft Word will recreate a new one.
But, keep in mind that you could lose some of your customizations
if you do that. Instead I would recommend that you do a Find (F3)
for the normal.dot file on your computer and rename it to
something like "old-normal.dot" (sans quotes). Make sure that
Microsoft Word is closed when you do this. If you open Word 2000
after renaming the normal.dot file, then you should have a blank
document, as Word will create a new template file to replace the
missing one. <P>

Now, I know you are curious about how to retrieve the
customizations that were in your old document template file. You
can find the instructions to retrieve your files by going to Help
(F1), doing a search for "using the organizer" (sans quotes) and
then choosing "use settings from another document or template"
(sans quotes). All this information comes to you courtesy of
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;en-us;q247028">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article - 247028</a>. Now
that you have the fix, don't go too hard on the kids because I'm
sure you know that we geeks started out the same way, and you have
NO idea how many programs and computers we broke before we learned
how to fix them. Experience is the best way to learn. [Brian]
