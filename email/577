By Jeff Fischer

Many of us have a tendency to want to follow something, invest
in something, believe in something, or root for something well
after it has done well. Witness: Swarms of investors buy the
latest, hottest mutual funds just in time to see them cool down,
more people owned stock in early 2000, at the peak, than any
other time in history, and winning sports teams soon find they
have more fans than ever imagined. (I can't wait for the Cubs to
make the World Series. No, really, I can't. I don't have that
many decades left.)With that in mind, it's time to review how
our holdings did in the year 2002 -- the year of corporate
scandal, "Waiting for Terrorists," "Iraq in the Crosshairs"
(that classy cable news!), and Year 3 of "Market Meltdown"
(trademarked probably by CNBC).

We had a few strong investments in '02, so the question now is,
"As they attracted more investors last year, will the stocks
remain strong this year? And what really matters -- will they be
strong for many years to come? And will Louis Rukeyser use less
makeup than a cadaver?"

First, as if you needed the cheery reminder, the major indexes
tanked again last year. The S&P 500 lost 23%, the Nasdaq,
plunging more than a plunger, is down another 31%, and the Dow
lost a comparatively benign 17%, which was its worst annual loss
since bell-bottoms. I mean, the first time.

Our portfolio was a non-event. Really. It was. It stuck with the
market averages like cotton sticks on candy that is sticky after
being licked, or when a sucker's put on the floor and picks up a
bunch of hair. Let's take a look.


                                 2002 RETURN
COMPANY                         (OR REDUCTION)
-----------------------------------------------
LendingTree (Nasdaq: TREE)          +118%
*Sirius Satellite (Nasdaq: SIRI)     -95%
Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN)            +75%
Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX)              +7%
eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY)                   +1%
Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN)                 -14%
S&P 500                              -23%
Overall RB return                    -23%
*Guitar Center (Nasdaq: GTRC)        +21%
AOL Time Warner (NYSE: AOL)          -59%
Millennium (Nasdaq: MLNM)            -68%

*short position

Six of our investments topped the S&P 500, and three lost to it.
The toppers outweighed the floppers. LendingTree had a
tremendous run, having started the year around five bucks a
share. We didn't buy it until $13, so we didn't see that return.
Sirius Satellite had a disastrous year, where only the shorts
made money. We were on the right side of that one. The next
eye-popper is Amazon, up 75%. Wasn't 2002 the worst holiday
shopping season for, what is the media saying, 1,800 years?
Whatever, it was a bad year for retail. All of it. Sears (NYSE:
S) blew up. Home Depot (NYSE: HD) blew up. Merry-Go-Round blew
up. (Well, they went bankrupt in the early '90s, but roll with
me here.) Yet, Amazon soared. Amazon -- our winged chariot, our
roaring provider of life, our online Eden -- yeah, it rose.

The stock sits mightily at $21 per share, giving the company a
market value of $8 billion. Twice, sometime in 2001, I wrote that
at around $14 per share I'd wait to buy the stock -- that it
looked pricey, that there was time to wait until it was closer to
profitability, because it probably wouldn't do much. And for a
long time it didn't. Except, well, then it vaulted 50%.

Why? Why?! Because David Gardner picked it at $14 in Motley Fool
Stock Advisor a few months back? Because now it's close to
seeing profits? Because lower prices helped sales? Anyway,
what's more important now is will the stock hold this Park Place
price, or will it drift back down? Is there upside for investors
chasing last year's good thing, or is it too late? And does Pete
Rose cut his own hair? (I sometimes do. And it shows.)
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=797787

Let's look at some financials. Amazon will have about $3.9
billion in 2002 sales. It had free cash flow of $120 million the
last 12 months. This will pop in quarter four alongside an
expected pro forma operating profit. The company recently had
$327 million in cash and equivalents and $2.2 billion in
long-term debt, giving it an enterprise value of $9.9 billion.

Its net loss was $151 million the first nine months of 2002,
much better than the $572 million lost the same period of 2001.
Finally, compromised as it is, a pro forma profit is expected
this year and in 2003. The company trades at 81 times trailing
free cash flow, and 87 times the average estimate of $0.24 per
share for 2003 earnings. Right now, sales are expected to grow
about 10% in '03, but I'm betting Amazon will raise guidance
into the teens after a strong 2002.

So, Amazon in a nutshell: Business shaping up, cash position
certain, free cash flow set to climb, a safer buy than when
things were much less certain 18 months ago, but also less
likely to beat the market here at forward multiples above 80 and
long-term growth rates well below that. Business risk is much
lower now, but valuation risk is considerable. That said, Amazon
will likely see its free cash flow soar the next few years.

So, a good buy here? Or too pricey? I don't know. We can't know.
For one thing, the market doesn't always care about valuation
(did you notice that?). At least not in the intermediate term.
So, I don't know. Nobody knows. I could pretend to know and then
charge you for the answer, if you want. (Or, in The Motley Fool
Select, we give you enough analysis and information to make your
own decisions.)
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=797788

Let's move to some other deep observations about our stocks and
2002. Look at the list up there again. (Or don't. Suit yourself.)
What's interesting to me is that Starbucks and eBay, two stocks
many people think perpetually overvalued, both rose as the market
tanked. Either the things deserve their premiums or they're (for
a few years now) living on borrowed time.

I side with the "They deserve it" camp -- until they do something
wrong, that is. Like Amazon, valuation makes them risky. One
misstep and... But no misstep, and the train keeps going. (eBay
is at 62 times '03 earnings estimates, while growing around 50%.
Starbucks, 26 times estimates while growing 20%.) Amgen also held
up well to the indexes, despite many seeing it as richly valued.
At 28 times '03 earnings estimates, and growing 25%, I think
Amgen is positioned to at least retain its value, in the
intermediate term, and rise later.

Guitar Center, our newest position, was sold short after it rose
last year, so we were sitting on even money there -- until it
jumped 21% today. The company stated strong year-end sales. After
its numbers are released, we'll have more to say. Tom Jacobs (TMF
Tom9) is expecting more erosion of fundamentals while management
keeps everyone focused on sales.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=797789

Finally, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, our absolute worst
investment in 2002, is the only one we bought more of last
year. At least, you can't say we only chase the hot ones.
Hopefully, our contrarian purchase will pay off. If not, we'll
blame Tom Jacobs.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=797790

Have a great... yeah, yeah... everyone. Smile. Goodbye. Wave.
Trip off stage.

Who designed this thing? (Hitting chest.) You can view Jeff
Fischer's stock holdings and the Fool's distemper policy.

*Dividends added. Or, danger ahead. Whatever.

**Compound Annual Growth Rate using Internal Rate of Return.
This performance measure is more meaningful than total return
because we began adding cash occasionally in July 2001. In a
total return calculation, or ((Current Value - All Cash
Deposited)/All Cash Deposited), cash added would show up as
returns. And that wouldn't be cricket!

***What's this? The Rule Breaker Portfolio's precursor, the Fool
Portfolio, was born Aug. 4, 1994. In a 10/20/98 column, David
Gardner announced the name change of the Fool Portfolio to the
Rule Breaker Portfolio. Here we provide returns as if the RB
Port started on either date. Remember, don't mimic any online
portfolio. Most individual investors should restrict any
positions as risky as these to under 20% of their portfolio --
and could have a long and happy investing life with 0%.

Starbucks, 26 times estimates&nbsp;while growing 20%.)&nbsp;Amgen also held up well to the indexes, despite many seeing it as richly valued.&nbsp;At 28 times '03 earnings estimates, and growing 25%, I&nbsp;think Amgen is positioned to at least retain its value, in the intermediate term, and rise later.</P>
<P>Guitar Center, our newest position, was sold short after it rose last year, so we were&nbsp;sitting on even money there -- until it jumped 21% today. The company&nbsp;stated strong year-end <A href="http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=797769">sales</A>. After its&nbsp;numbers are released, we'll have more to say. Tom Jacobs (TMF Tom9) is expecting more erosion of fundamentals while management keeps everyone focused on sales.</P>
<P>Finally, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, our absolute worst investment in 2002, is the only one we bought <A href="http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=797770">more</A> of last year. At least, you can't say we only chase the hot ones. Hopefully, our contrarian purchase will pay off. If not, we'll blame Tom Jacobs.</P>
<P>Have a great... yeah, yeah... everyone. Smile. Goodbye. Wave. Trip off stage.</P>

<P>*Dividends added. Or, danger ahead. Whatever.</P>
<P>**<A href="http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=797773">Compound Annual Growth Rate</A> using <A href="http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=797774">Internal Rate of Return</A>. This performance measure is more meaningful than total return because we began adding cash occasionally in July 2001. In a total return calculation, or ((Current Value - All Cash Deposited)/All Cash Deposited), cash added would show up as returns. And that wouldn't be cricket!</P>
<P>***What's this? The Rule Breaker Portfolio's precursor, the Fool Portfolio, was born Aug. 4, 1994. In a 10/20/98 <A href="http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=797775">column</A>, David Gardner announced the&nbsp;name change of the Fool Portfolio to the Rule Breaker Portfolio. Here we provide returns as if the RB Port started on either date. Remember, <A href="http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=797776">don't mimic</A> any online portfolio. Most individual investors should restrict&nbsp;any positions as risky as these to under 20% of their portfolio --&nbsp;and could have a long and happy investing life with 0%.</P></SPAN>
