						<p class="headline"><a name="1">&nbsp;FINANCIAL AID ADVICE: Avoiding Common Mistakes</a>
						
						<p class="norm">Since the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is
probably the most important financial aid document you'll ever meet, make
sure you avoid making the most common mistakes:

						<p class="norm"><b>Waiting too long to get started.</b><br>
						Complete the FAFSA as soon as possible after January 1st of the year
you'll need funding. While we all hope that nothing goes wrong, you'll
want plenty of time to recover in case there's a glitch in your
processing.  Also, some institutional aid is given out on a first-come,
first-served basis.  You don't want them to run out of money before your
FAFSA has been processed!
						
						<p class="norm">If you don't have the Tax information necessary to file, <b>estimate</b>
your parents'/your 2002 income.  Most schools set February 15th as the
priority filing deadline for incoming students and March 15 for returning
students.  Both of those dates come well in advance of the April 15 tax
filing deadline so using estimates may be your only option to get your
FAFSA filed on time.

						<p class="norm"><b>Thinking you don’t need the FAFSA.</b><br>
						Filing the FAFSA is essential even if you don't think you will
qualify for federal financial aid. The FAFSA determines eligibility for
Federal Student Aid programs as well as eligibility for many private
grant/scholarship programs.  Because so many non-government aid programs
use the FAFSA in order to determine who gets the scholarships, loans, and
other aid they offer, filling out the FAFSA can be a lifesaver even for
those who won't be getting federal aid.

						<p class="norm"><b>Assuming the FAFSA is all you’ll need.</b><br>
						Often, you'll need more than just the FAFSA. Incoming freshman at
many private colleges may also need to complete the CSS Profile
Application. Your school probably also has its own financial aid
applications. And if your federal aid is not enough, you'll need to be
ready to fill out those scholarship and student loan applications.
						
						<p class="norm">Also, you may not be able to complete your financial aid application
until you have provided documents that verify the information you
submitted on your FAFSA.  The best rule of thumb is to provide the school
whatever they ask for as quickly as you can after receiving a notice from
them.  Do not put off following up with requested documentation as it
could jeopardize your funding.

						<p class="norm"><b>Not keeping track of what you're doing and what you've done.</b><br>
						Before you get started, gather together all the documents you'll
need (you'll find a list of these at
http://estudentloan.com/content/begin/undergrad/undergraduate_2.asp). 
When you're finished, make a copy of your paper application and send the
original to the appropriate address. Or, if you applied online, print a
copy. Don’t forget to sign and date your application!

						<p class="norm"><b>Not seeking help.</b><br>
						The FAFSA is too important to blow off. If you're lost, confused, or
if you or your family have special circumstances, contact your school's
financial aid office -- they’re professionals, and they'll be happy to
help you out. Also, call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243)/ TDD
1-800-730-8913 if you have general questions about what information you
need to report on the FAFSA, or to check on the status of your
application.

						<p class="norm"> If you've been considering <a href="http://theoldschool.org/go/to.asp?l=cons58">consolidating</a> your current student
loans, now is the time to stop thinking about it and get it done.  July
1st 2002 marked a change in the interest rate charged for consolidation
loans.  The big news is that this rate is the lowest it has ever been (and
is as low as it is likely to ever be).

						<p class="norm">If you have over $15,000 in student loans and are making or about to
begin making payments, you should look into a <a href="http://theoldschool.org/go/to.asp?l=cons58">Federal Consolidation loan</a>.

						<p class="norm">Loan consolidation has a few terrific advantages:

						<p class="norm"><b>Low Interest Rates</b><br>
						Because interest rates are at historic lows and most student loans
are variable interest rate loans, the current rate on your student loan is
likely to be at or near its lowest point ever.  The beauty of a Federal
Consolidation loan is that it combines all your eligible student loans
into one FIXED rate loan -- you can lock in a low interest rate for the
life of the consolidation loan.  When interest rates rise, your loan rate
won't, because you locked it in with a fixed rate consolidation loan.

						<p class="norm"><b>Lower Monthly Payments</b><br>
						Another great feature of a <a href="http://theoldschool.org/go/to.asp?l=cons58">Federal Consolidation loan</a> is it allows
most borrowers to extend the repayment period for their student loans,
which lowers their monthly payment.  While extending your repayment period
will likely increase the total amount of interest you pay, we all know
having a lower student loan payment can be a lifesaver when you need a
little extra cash.

						<p class="norm">And on top of all that, there are no costs or credit checks involved
for <a href="http://theoldschool.org/go/to.asp?l=cons58">federal loan consolidation</a>.

						<p class="norm">So if you're interested in saving thousands of dollars or reducing
your monthly student loan payment, now is the time to look into a <a href="http://theoldschool.org/go/to.asp?l=cons58">Federal
Consolidation loan</a>.
