 Birthstone Rings from your Jewelry/Accessories Guide
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/B9a
 Here's an easy way to locate a birthstone ring for yourself, a family member or a special friend. Choose the price category you're comfortable with and quickly compare styles and prices. You'll find a large number of rings made with stones placed in a variety of settings.
 1. Birthstone Rings - Up to $50
 Some of the birthstone rings in this category are set in 10K gold. A few smaller stones with delicate settings are in 14K gold. Most birthstones are represented, but cubic zirconias replace diamonds for April birthdates.
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/B9Z
 2. Birthstone Rings - $51 - $100
 As you might expect, this price range contains a larger selection of birthstone rings than the first. You'll find somewhat larger stones and more rings made with 14K gold. Small diamonds begin to appear in this category. This is a multi-page selection that contains a very nice variety of birthstone rings.
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/B9[
 3. Birthstone Rings - $151 - $200
 Fewer rings are offered in this category, but they have more or larger stones and are set in 14K gold.

 ------------------------ Clueless About Fashion ---------------------------
 Totally Clueless About What the Fashion is
 "I need help as I am totally clueless about what the fashion is. I am trying to get rid of the 80s look thankfully the big hair was gone long time ago. I am totally out of touch with everything of fashion and am wanting a makeover without the big bucks. I discovered hiphuggers/bellbottoms and look good in them but what kind of tops to wear with them?..." - Little_Eagle_Squaw
