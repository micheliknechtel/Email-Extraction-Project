THE INSIDE TRACK ON SOFTWAREJOBS
by Allen Davis

Changes are on the way! As the job market begins its painfully slow 
revival, led by a resurgence of contract opportunities, I wanted to take a 
minute and mention changes we are making at SoftwareJobs to serve 
our users in these changing times.

Starting this week, we will be featuring a group of current contracts in 
our newsletter, and will provide a link to a new page on SoftwareJobs 
devoted to contract opportunities. This page 
(http://m1e.net/c?73333-y8AMVwYa3nSAo%40126672-efT8Fku59rhZU) is an index of 
opportunities available through SoftwareJobs’ contract division, 
SoftwareContracts, Inc. These positions are filled in hours and days, 
not months, so I advise members to visit the page on a regular basis. 
You can also access these positions from the “Contracts” button at the 
top of the SoftwareJobs home page.

In most cases, you won’t find these positions advertised anywhere else. 
These are positions that our clients and partner staffing firms generally 
share with each other, but are rarely released to the general population 
of software professionals. 

We see this new feature as a tool for the contract professional who, in 
addition to doing the work as an IT professional, needs to spend 
considerable time marketing his or her services. Our contracts system 
will provide you with an up-to-the-minute view of premium contract 
positions all over the country and in every niche of the profession, from 
ERP to mainframes to the newest programming languages and 
approaches.

In addition, over the next few months, we will be premiering additional 
features on the site that will give IT professionals direct access to the 
channels used by the big staffing firms to fill contract positions. We 
believe that there will be a growing need for staffing firms and end-user 
companies to recruit independent consultants and professionals who are 
between permanent assignments for contract positions. We are excited 
to be providing ways to facilitate this process.

As well as the listing of new contract positions posted on the 
SoftwareJobs site, this newsletter also will feature positions from our 
clients and partners, as well as timely information about trends in 
contracting, the job market, and the IT profession in general. Stay tuned 
-- it’s still a bumpy ride, but I think we have a shot of leaving the 
turbulence behind us during the months ahead!

Please email me at Allen_Davis@softwarejobs.com with your 
comments and questions
