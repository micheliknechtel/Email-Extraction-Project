Subject: USACO January Contest: Postponed Indefinitely
Precedence: bulk
Sender: kolstad@ace.delos.com
To: "Mailshell User" <nospam@mailshell.com>

I regret to announce that the weekend USACO programming contest has
been postponed indefinitely.  The holiday season caught up with the
coaches and the contest simply will not be ready on time.  If it is
possible, the contest will be held on an alternate date.  Otherwise,
you will never hear about it again.

Thus, the schedule becomes:
       2003 Feb 7-11  -- Five hours  -- USACO February Tournament
       2003 Mar 7-11  -- Three hours -- USACO March Contest
       2003 April     -- Five hours  -- USACO U S Open (proctored)

I am now consider April 7, 8, or 9 for the U S Open.  Please let me
know quickly if you wish to participate but find that those dates are
not acceptable.

In other news, the USACO camp date has been moved to the first week
in June, approximately June 1-7 (plus/minus two days).

PS: If you are one of those few hundred who signed up recently for
    the USACO mailing list and now realize that you are really not
    that interested in hearing about contests and results, please send
    me back a note telling me to unsubscribe you (including your ZZ
    number saves me a lot of time).
