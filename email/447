<tr><td><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">About 30 years ago, then President Richard Nixon declared war on cancer. 
Over the last 3 decades we have spent literally tens of billions of
dollars on research and treatment for this devastating illness.  Despite
this, it is estimated that there will be approximately 1,268,000 new cases
of invasive cancer diagnosed this year with about 553,000 deaths.  That
represents over 1,500 deaths every day.  Not exactly a war that we're
winning.  Do you know that the chance of you developing an invasive form
of cancer in your lifetime is about 40%?  Worldwide it is estimated that
cancer incidence and death will double in the next 20 years. Is the
situation hopeless or are there proactive things you can do to lower the
odds?  The answer is clearly yes, to the latter.  Cigarette smoking is
probably the number one causative factor in the development of cancer.  If
you smoke, give it up.  See your doctor about getting on a patch or oral
medication, try hypnosis or acupuncture.  Even by cutting the number of
cigarettes in half, you can substantially lower your risk of many
different cancers.  Maintaining a healthy diet and losing unnecessary
pounds may not only decrease your risk of cancer but also diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, arthritis, etc.  There are clear studies that
indicate certain vitamins and minerals can lower the incidence of cancer.

supplement SAM was actually as effective as some conventional
anti-depressants in the treatment of depression.  SAM, however, has also
been studied extensively and has shown to be of great benefit in the
treatment of osteoarthritis, a condition that afflicts tens of millions of
people.  Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate have also been shown to be
effective in osteoarthritis.  There is a product on the market that
contains not only SAM, but also the correct forms (sulfate form) and
