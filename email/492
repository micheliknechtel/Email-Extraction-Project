Hi all,

Just wanted to apologize for the confusing moderator comment in
issue # 775. Adventive publications were shut down over the Holidays
and I didn't pay close attention to the notice.  I submitted the
pre-Christmas issue too late to be published, then re-submitted the
pre-New Year issue which got published after the New Year.  It was a
very hectic holiday season for me and I am sorry for the confusion.
We should be back on track now.

YHM,

--Michael

Is it possible to add Outlook 2002 to my startup so that it opens when
I boot/reboot?

Subject: How do I restore email?

My hard drive crashed. Fortunately, I had everything backed-up on a
CD. I restored all my files without problems except for my email
folders which I can not now open.

I am using Outlook Express and the original folders were stored at
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Local Settings\Application
Data\Identities\{4903A7CA-6040-49BE-93FE-2461E20F0389}\Microsoft\Out
look Express. (The usual place Microsoft hides the emails.) I backed
up the emails by right clicking and using 'Go To' to send the
folders to the back up CDRom. (The folders are on the CD.)

When I tried to restore the folders, I created a same name folder
for each in Outlook Express, deleted the new folders from the above
location and copied my back-up folders into that location to take
their place.

In theory, and according to the magazine in front of me, this should
work.... but it does not.

I also tried the Import function in the File menu, but this looks
for messages and address books - not folders full of messages.

Does anyone know a work around that will restore my emails?

All help will be much appreciated.

Thanks.

Subject: RE: Dual boot info request - Digest # 774 & 775

Sylve;

Speaking as a Win98SE/Win2000 dual boot user, I set mine up just like
you are planning to do. Installed 98 first, 2000 second, with some
programs on Drive F (I might add a third OS) and some programs on the
same partition as the OS.

I didn't really run into many problems as far as installing over top of
things.  Just make sure you install everything using the same version of
course, so it doesn't update drivers and such of course...

As far as different versions, most programs will often install different
versions into different sub-folders.  If not, you could even create the
sub-folders yourself using the custom installation choice.  It might
help prevent possible conflicts between drivers and such.

As far as your printer drivers, you won't have any problems here.  I
installed my printer/scanner/Palm/camera under both, and didn't have any
problems.  Each is dependant on the OS, so it only applies to that OS in
the registry.

You will still have to update the Anti-V*rus signatures under each OS.
Unfortunately, every time I've updated my Norton under one, I need to do
the same under the other as well.

One GREAT advantage I can mention about a dual boot, is that should your
one OS take a nose dive, you won't come to a complete stop.  You just
boot up to your other OS and keep right on moving until you have a
chance to go back and fix the other.  Just make sure if you change the
time to display the OS choices, you don't set it under about 10 seconds.
That gives you at least some time to respond before it boots into the
default OS.

Good luck and I'd like to hear your results as well.

Thomas

Well, it's done and up and running like a top! Thanks for the input Don,
John and Allen. You were right on with the dual install of common
programs Don and John. Partition Magic is a good program Allen but I am
an old DOS person and fdisk has always been my choice - it never causes
partition overlap or problems. I tend to shy away from 3rd party apps if
there is a viable resident choice - less possible conflict.

What and how? I backed up all my personal data to CDs and then fdisked
and partitioned my 60 gig drive into 5 equal partitions. Formatted in
FAT32 as I prefer to be able to fall back to DOS should there be problems.

Created an "install98" folder on the F: and installed 98 on the C: and
then downloaded all the updates I felt were applicable to my system.
Applied all my system tweaks and then burned an ISO of the clean install.

Integrated SP1 into my XP install files, created an "installXP" folder
on F: and then installed XP on D:. Downloaded and installed the newest
criticals for the OS from the update site and did the XP tweaks that I
felt were needed (remove messenger, dump indexing, cancel error
reporting etc.)

Burned an ISO of both C: (with its added files for dual boot) and D:.

Installed my film scanner into 98 (No driver for either the card or the
CanoScan 2710 for XP! Lots of money for a unit that will have no drivers
written for it for XP) along with the software. XP sees the card but
ignores it.

Software: All word processing apps overlap wonderfully! Both Office 2000
and Word Perfect 10 with Presentations are happy residing in one place
with calls from two different OSes. As I will rarely be on line in 98, I
did not install either my Virus checker (Panda) nor Zone Alarm in Win98.
All Graphic apps are also happy campers: Micrographx and Adobe Photoshop
are content along with Lview, ACDSee and several Corel apps.

Installed my older version of Easy CD 4 in Win98 because I like the
control it gives me when I take LPs to CD. XP got Roxio's 5.3. Both
versions reside in a single Adaptec folder inside their own subfolder.
When they were installed, as there was no ref to the "other" in the
registry, the install was without hitch in both Oses.

Netscape 4.79 on Win98 and Netscape 7.0 in XP. No problems. IE 5.5 in 98
and 6.1 in XP.

A single pain in the #$@%$% - Quicken! As XP will be my main OS, it is
installed there. John, you were right - that program does not like two
masters!

As far as drivers, each OS loads its own. What I find interesting is
that I have a single machine, yet the XP drivers allow for faster
EVERYTHING including downloads with a 56K modem. Have found a utility
that backs up all driver info (creates *.inf files) and plan to try an
upgrade on the Win98 drivers. Will not do so till I have burned an ISO
of both C: and D: with all software info installed into each OS's registry.

Present config:
C:\ Win98
D:\ WinXP
E:\ Software
F:\ All personal info along with original install folders and collected
installable utility originals
G:\ Pictures and Graphic files

John, you had suggested a second machine but I have limited space in my
office - this fits my needs well so far. What I do plan to do is clone
all partitions onto a second hard drive (much cheaper and less space
demanding).

It's been an experience. Took me about 3 days working off and on in the
evenings as I work during the day. If anyone has any questions or
additional suggestions, feel free to email me. What an experience this
has been.

Sylve

i have two *small* progs for saving/restoring CMOS settings that i
have had since DOS Daze; they will fit on a boot floppy that has all
the other boot files. do you want me to upload them?

i don't know where to get them out on the net.
