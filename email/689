Hello Travelers,

Here's a tidbit of useful information from CNN Travel for 
those of us that use Amtrak Trains for traveling.

"Citing a slight dip in the number of its passengers the last 
year, Amtrak plans to cut coach fares as much as 25 percent 
on many of its routes nationwide in an effort to boost 
revenue."
