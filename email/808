- Weekly Platform Trends: SiS' 655 Joins the Dual-DDR Party

Dual-channel DDR is the must-have memory-controller design among performance
PC chipsets, so SiS' newest Pentium 4 platform boasts dual DDR333 support.
But has Intel's move to Hyper-Threading and, soon, an 800MHz system bus
spoiled SiS' product planning?

Weekly Platform Trends: SiS' 655 Joins the Dual-DDR Party
But Where's the HT Beef?

The prospect of owning a dual-channel DDR system is an attractive one for
many power users. Intel started this trend with its 850 and 850E chipsets,
whose dual-channel memory controllers have basically owned the
high-performance Pentium 4 market since inception.

There are two main reasons for this: performance and value. Dual-channel
architecture can theoretically double the memory bandwidth of a desktop
platform, and with a 533MHz-bus Pentium 4, memory bandwidth is an integral
part of overall performance. Value is also key, as dual-channel design gives
new life to older and cheaper memory: In the case of Intel's E7205 "Granite
Bay" workstation chipset, dual-channel architecture lets even low-end DDR266
prove more than a match for even PC1066 RDRAM.

In short, the handwriting is on the wall, and the platforms that will carry
us into 2003 will almost certainly include dual-channel memory architecture.
One of the first to emerge is the SiS 655, whose main selling point is the
inclusion of dual-channel DDR333.

This is what many users hoped for from Granite Bay, only to find they must
keep waiting for Intel's Springdale -- SiS has seemingly turned the tables
on the Intel juggernaut, especially considering how aggressively the CPU
giant has been marketing and releasing new chipsets.

On the other hand, the lack of other new features -- and the fact that dual
DDR333 isn't actually necessary to satisfy the 4.2GB/sec bandwidth of a
533MHz-bus Pentium 4 -- raise the question, what's the point? In fact, the
SiS 655 looks a whole lot like merely a SiS 648 with an additional memory
channel ...

E.G. for Example: Your Next PC? You Won't Recognize It
Pundits (including HwC's editor) have pontificated about notebooks replacing
desktop PCs, but while sales trends point that way, they're not moving that
quickly. That's given desktops time to strike back -- and what's the trend
that ties the newest corporate office systems, Shuttle's high-performance
cubes, and Sony's Vaio W coffee-table conversation piece? Let's get small.

Maxtor, Iomega, SmartDisk Expand External Hard Disk Choices
Whether you're looking for a pocket-size 60GB drive or a desktop-swift 200GB
model with one-button backup, new portable hard disks from SmartDisk,
Iomega, and Maxtor offer a variety of FireWire- and USB 2.0-based storage
and file-sharing options.

Microsoft Introduces Windows Media 9, Updated Player and Movie Maker
New versions of Windows XP's Media Player and Movie Maker (free) and a
party-jukebox Plus pack ($20) are just part of Microsoft's new plan to set
the standard for high-quality streaming audio and video: The software
giant's licensing its copy-protection-friendly technologies at half the cost
of rivals such as MPEG-4.
