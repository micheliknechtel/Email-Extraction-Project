BETWEEN YOU & ME

   REMEMBERING THE HIGHS AND THE LOWS
   While I was at home visiting my parents for the holidays, I
   ran across a sparkly gold sweater in one of the trunks where
   some of my things are packed. I hadn't worn the sweater for a
   few years--in fact, it is the sweater that I wore when I took
   my senior pictures in high school--and I'd forgotten I had
   it.

   As I held that sweater in front of me, memories of my senior
   year suddenly flooded my mind. I thought about how
   uncomfortable I felt changing high schools my senior year and
   being the new girl--every "first" experience at my new school
   was also my "last." I remembered the mixed feelings I had
   about my new friendships. As good as it felt to have new
   friends, I also felt sad because I could never get as close to
   them as they were to each other.

   "I'm responsible, dependable, friendly and mature, but I'm
   really boring. I don't believe people at school think I'm a
   loser, I'm just Susan, the goody-goody, Christian, nice girl.
   Is this how I'm supposed to be?"
