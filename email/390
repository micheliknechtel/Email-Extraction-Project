better if

an attempt
        to do so, you're probably not going to get much satisfaction in
that area.
        Alot of women don't like going down on their man for a few
reasons. Some
        men are smelly, some are too hairy, and some are too big. Some
take too
        long to come, some have too much pre-come, and some just taste
bad. Talk
        to your lady and find out just what it is that turns her off about
giving
        you head. Her answers may suprise you, and they may not. Either
way, communication
        is the name of the game. good luck, and here's to some good head

        this is how it is. At my christmas party for work i hooked up with
a manager,
        who i liked very much and she liked me. Now however she does not

question
        is this. HOW CAN I WIN HER HEART BACK OVER AND MAKE HER LIKE ME
AGAIN?</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My dear,
        you cannot make something happen. If she has a personal policy of
not
        mixing business with pleasure, then you'll have no choice but to
live
        with it. If, however, you can make yourself the most irresistable,
attractive,
        loving, fun, adult male she's ever run into, she may have no
choice but
        to change her mind. Remember: One key part of adulthood and
maturity is
        discreetness. But, also remember that not everyone wants to take
the chance
        on finding out if another person has reached that level of
maturity. -Anastasia

      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have
        done some research regarding enemas, and much to my niave suprise,
found
        that many people use them for sexual pleasure, as well as for
bodily cleanliness.
        Those people that use enemas for sexual pleasure are called
Klismaphilias.
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Enemas
        have traditionally been used for rectal and colonic health. There
are
        foods that we eat (mostly red meats) that the body does not
completely
        digest. The left-over materials stay in the colon. An enema will
clean
        the colon, and is said to often promote feelings of well-being,
cleanliness,
        clearness, and euphoria.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While
        an enema will not improve the amount of semen a man produduces, it
can
        stimulate the male G-spot, or prostate. The action of the water
moving
        over the prostate has brought some men to orgasm without having
ever touched
        their penis.</font></p>

your
        own enema kit if one is not readily available in your area. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To address
        your concern that the amount of ejaculate you have is too little,
practice
        is the key. You must practice waiting to come for as long as
possible.
        When you feel like you must come, stop. Hold it as long as you
can. Doing
        this as often as possible will not only lengthen the amount of
time it
        takes for you to come, but will also help to build up the amount
of semen
        you ejaculate. But, please don't expect miracles. This takes alot
oftime
        and patience. Appreciable results may not be seen for six months
or more.
        If that's the case, don't be disappointed. Look forward to the day
that
        you reach your goal. Your wife should appreciate it too. </font></p>

        ruminations...</font></i></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greetings! What
        a day! Weather-wise it was the pits and mood-wise, well I needed a
pick-me-upper.
        So I ditched the office and went shopping....for lingerie! <br>
        <br>
        My first intention was just to window-shop, and then I went into
my favourite
        boutique to browse and look at the new arrivals. And wow! The
articles
        ranged from comfortable and darling to down-right naughty and very
sexy!
        <br>
        <br>
        I recently read that Catherine Zeta-Jones exchanged over $500
worth of
        jewel coloured lingerie for black because Michael Douglas likes
only black!
        Smart lady! When I go shopping for sexy underwear, I do so with my
lover's
        pleasures in mind because I know if he's turned-on, I will be
reaping
        the benefits.<br>
        <br>
        As I picked out different outfits to try on, my mind wandered back
to
        a time when personal circumstances had forced us apart. While we
kept
        in touch by phone and email and IMs, how do you keep the sexual
tension
        turned on? I remember one weekend, I thought it was time to
motivate him
        and turn up the heat. A webcam is such a useful item to have! <br>
        <br>
        I felt something was needed to keep the interest and spark going;
if it
        erupted into an inferno - well all the better! I took a series of
pictures
        - each series was a strip tease - with the last pic always a
provocative
        shot of me wearing only a pair of stiletto heels and some
delectable items
        of lingerie. I felt like a model in a Victoria's Secret catalogue!
<br>
        <br>
        Every Monday I would start a striptease email and send him the
first of
        usually 5 pics - so that on the Friday he would receive the last
one.
        Occasionally I'd surprise him and the last one was me wearing only
the
        heels!! His reaction was great! Sometimes while looking at the
pics on
        his computer, he'd call me and what would follow would be some
pretty
        torrid phone sex! Hey don't knock it till you've tried it - and at
least
        with phone sex you only need one hand!! <br>
        <br>
        Eventually, his business concluded and he was able to rejoin me.
He's
        kept those pics - he said they certainly inspired him during the
long
        days and lonely nights we were apart. Occasionally we look at them
together,
        and he asks me what was going through my mind when this or that
shot was
        taken - ah! memories.<br>
        <br>
        You know, next time you are parted from your lover or if perhaps
you are
        involved in a long distance affair, do yourselves both a favour to
keep
        the flames fanned! The effects will be three-fold. You'll have fun
shopping
        for the lingerie, you'll have fun showing your purchases off and
the heat
        that follows will be just too delicious! <br>
        <br>
        Hmmm my calendar shows he will be away on a business trip next
week...he
        is due for a treat and I do need to model my new purchases for
him. Till
        we meet again...Marya</font></p>

      <p> I am an 18-year-old female with long, wavy brown hair and a
36-24-35<br>
        figure. It takes a lot to turn me on, so I'm just friends with the
guys
        in<br>
        my neighborhood, but I like to dress in sexy outfits for the
pleasure
        of<br>
        their stares. A month ago, a new family moved in down the street,
and
        I<br>
        decided to welcome my new neighbors and get acquainted with them.
They
        had a<br>
        very attractive daughter my age named Kay, and it wasn't long
before we
        were<br>
        good friends. One day after Kay's family had settled in, I went
over to
        pick<br>
        her up to go shopping. As I pulled into the driveway, I saw the
most<br>
        handsome guy imaginable shooting baskets. He was my height with
long,
        black,<br>
        spiked hair and an incredible body -- all the more evident because
he
        wore<br>
        only a pair of jams. I was mesmerized by his beauty. Kay came out,
and
        I<br>
        eagerly asked her who the hunk was. &quot;My brother,&quot; she
replied.
        &quot;Isn't he<br>
        cute!&quot; I soon found out that Kay's parents had adopted Vin as a
child.
        Do<br>
        you like him?&quot; Kay asked. &quot;He's hot!!&quot; I replied with
a
        big smile. We both<br>
        walked up the driveway, and Kay introduced us. I looked Vin over
from
        head<br>
        to toe, and the sight of the sweat pouring down his body made my
panties<br>
        randy with excitement. I could tell that Vin was also impressed by
my<br>
        assets --accentuated by a white cotton halter top and tight black
jogging<br>
        shorts. Kay and I decided to shoot some hoop with Vin, and the
three of
        us<br>
        frolicked for a while. At one point, as I went in for a lay-up,
Vin shocked<br>
        me by accidentally grabbing my breast as I dribbled past him.
&quot;I'm
        sorry,&quot;<br>
        he said sheepishly. &quot;Foul!&quot; Kay laughed. &quot;I think
we've
        all had enough,&quot; she<br>
        added. As Kay led me to the house, I stared longingly at Vin. I
hoped
        that<br>
        he could see how aroused I was by his touch -- my nipples were so
hard
        that<br>
        they could be seen through the fabric of my top. Once inside, we
drank
        some<br>
        iced tea, but it did not cool the lust I felt for Vin. Soon he
came in,
        and<br>
        we sat around talking for a long time, forgetting that I had come
to go<br>
        shopping with Kay. I flirted with Vin by deliberately sticking my
chest
        out<br>
        and curving my body toward him. When I caught him staring, I got<br>
        embarrassed. I'm kind of awkward in these situations, and I hoped
I wasn't<br>
        fouling up. Then Kay asked if I would like to watch a new video in
her<br>
        bedroom, and I thought that it sounded like fun. We headed
upstairs, with
        me<br>
        secretly hoping that Vin would follow, but he didn't. Since Kay is
a really<br>
        cool girl, I was not surprised when she turned to me during the
movie
        and<br>
        said, &quot;So you like my brother?&quot; &quot;Oh,
desperately,&quot;
        I replied. &quot;It's okay,&quot;<br>
        she said. &quot;Lots of girls like him -- but he's still a virgin. I
think
        you<br>
        two could have some fun together and make a nice couple. Why don't
I go
        out<br>
        for some ice cream and leave you and Vin to get acquainted? I'll
bring
        some<br>
        back -- you might need to cool off!&quot; I couldn't believe my
luck!
        My friend<br>
        was giving me the okay to do it with her brother, and I really
liked this<br>
        guy. I was nervous and turned on at the same time. After Kay left,
I went<br>
        down the hall to her brother's room. I slowly turned the door
handle and<br>
        peaked in. There was Vin, lying on his bed, moaning and jerking
himself
        off!<br>
        &quot;Oops, I'm sorry,&quot; I apologized, blushing. Vin looked at
me
        as if he'd seen<br>
        a ghost. I laughed and said that it was a perfectly normal thing
for him
        to<br>
        be doing, and that it also turned me on. He replied that he had
become
        so<br>
        aroused by meeting me that he couldn't help but try to release his
pent-up<br>
        energy when he was alone. &quot;Well, you're not alone
anymore,&quot;
        I said. Vin<br>
        asked me where his sister had gone. I told him that she went out
for some<br>
        ice cream and that she would be back later with his favorite
flavor. &quot;How<br>
        could she do that when my favorite flavor is standing right in
front of
        me?&quot;<br>
        he said with a smile. &quot;I want to make love with you,&quot; was
my
        answer. I<br>
        looked straight into his brown eyes, and then got on top of him
and hungrily<br>
        kissed his lips and neck. He said that I was a dream come true. We
were
        both<br>
        a little awkward, but I got his pants off in record time. I licked
and<br>
        kissed my way down his beautiful torso until I came to his
wonderful cock.He<br>
        wasn't as big as some other guys I have touched, but it didn't
matter.
        There<br>
        was something more than animal lust between us already. As I began
to
        suck<br>
        his swollen member, Vin begged me to stop, saying that he would
cum if
        I<br>
        didn't. I guessed that he wanted to really enjoy his first time.
Vin took<br>
        off my top and gently removed my bra. Like a child with a new toy,
he
        felt<br>
        my ample tits. At that moment I felt that I was in love with him.
He got
        on<br>
        top of me and caressed my body with a slow and steady hand until I
was<br>
        totally hot. &quot;Pull my panties down!&quot; I begged. Vin
obliged,
        telling me that<br>
        he was in heaven. I asked him to rub his prick against my horny
pussy.
        As<br>
        his hot penis touched my body, I trembled with delight. Moving
lower,
        he<br>
        kissed my cunt lips and blew on my hair. I cooed like a baby as
Vin gently<br>
        nibbled on my cunt and then inserted his fingers and his tongue.
As a
        wave<br>
        of shuddering pleasure enveloped me, I knew that I was about to
come.
        &quot;Eat<br>
        me!&quot; I hollered, and Vin cupped his hands under my ass and
licked
        and sucked<br>
        my pussy and clit like a starving man. My orgasm made me lose my
breath
        for<br>
        a few moments, and Vin, being the gentleman, waited for me to
relax. I<br>
        wanted that babybeamer in me so bad, but Vin knew that it was my
first
        time<br>
        also, and he was determined to make it as smooth as possible. Vin
put
        a<br>
        pillow under my ass and tried to insert his hard member. Though I
was
        very<br>
        wet, I was still too tight. Vin was scared that he might hurt me,
but
        I was<br>
        incredibly turned on and waited lustfully for his rock-hard tool.<br>
        Positioning himself, Vin drove into my eager love nest. His cock
felt
        so<br>
        good and so big inside me. Soon he had me to the hilt, and my
muscles<br>
        tightened around his pole. &quot;Oh, yes!&quot; I gasped, &quot;Oh,
baby.
        Pump me, stud!&quot;<br>
        Vin was groaning and that turned me on even more. It was also
funny, even<br>
        though this was a serious thing, because we were having such a
good time.<br>
        Finally, his penis ruptured inside me, and then I came again, too.
After
        our<br>
        panting had quieted, we both drifted off to sleep, so satisfied
that we<br>
        didn't need any ice cream.</p>

      <p><font color="#660066">Letter to Sarah short fiction by The Bear - thebear@io.com</font></p>
      <p>The package was wrapped in brown paper and secured with duct- tape.
It
        was<br>
        addressed to Sarah at her parents' home address, and was waiting
for her
        on<br>
        the entry hall table when she got home from work one evening about
a week<br>
        before Christmas. Sarah picked up the package and went up the
half-flight<br>
        to the upstairs of the split-level house, to where her mother was
fixing<br>
        dinner in the kitchen. She hung her coat on a hook and looked to
see what<br>
        her mother was making - it was lasagne, yum. Sarah's mother turned
and
        saw<br>
        her in the doorway, and asked if she'd had a good day at work.
&quot;Pretty<br>
        busy,&quot;<br>
        Sarah answered her. &quot;I guess it will keep getting busier every
day
        right up<br>
        to Christmas Eve.&quot; Sarah was working at a department store in
her
        hometown<br>
        during Christmas Break to earn some extra spending money. Sarah's
mother<br>
        noticed the package. &quot;That came for you in the mail
today,&quot;
        she said.<br>
        &quot;Maybe a Christmas present from one of your friends from
school?&quot;
        Sarah<br>
        looked at the postmark - it was from Columbia, where she attended
Stephens<br>
        College. She had plenty of friends who had stayed in Columbia
during<br>
        Christmas Break, so it probably was from one of them, just as her
mother<br>
        suggested. &quot;Maybe,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm going to my room
to
        get out of these<br>
        clothes.&quot; She was required to wear a dress, panty-hose, and
pumps
        at work;<br>
        now she wanted to get into jeans and a sweatshirt. She took the
package<br>
        with her to her room. After she had changed clothes, Sarah got
curious<br>
        about the package and decided to open it to see who it was from,
because<br>
        there was no return address or other identification on the
outside.<br>
        She tore off the brown paper with some difficulty due to the
duct-tape
        seal,<br>
        and discovered that the paper was simply a grocery bag turned
inside out.<br>
        Inside the brown paper wrapping was a package wrapped in gold
gift- wrap<br>
        paper and secured with several windings of twine, knotted at each<br>
        intersection of the twine. Tucked into the twine was a plain
envelope
        with<br>
        her name on it. She didn't recognize the handwriting. She would
need<br>
        scissors to cut the twine before she could get into the package
itself,
        but<br>
        she managed to wiggle the envelope free, and opened it first.
Inside was
        a<br>
        letter: My Beloved Sarah, I want you to be alone when you read
this. She<br>
        quickly flipped to the end of the letter to see who it was from,
but it
        was<br>
        unsigned. Could it be from Tom?<br>
        Or from Brian? She couldn't think who else might address her as
&quot;Beloved&quot;
        -<br>
        at least not anyone who would know her parents' home address. The
letter<br>
        itself offered no clues - it was on plain white computer paper
(she could<br>
        see where the sheet-feeder edges had been ripped off) and had been
printed<br>
        on a dot-matrix printer. She dug in her purse for a copy of the
Christmas<br>
        shopping list that she had typed on Brian's computer and printed
on his<br>
        printer before coming home for Break. Both the paper and the
printing<br>
        looked the same to her eye, but that proved nothing - even if the
letter
        was<br>
        from Brian's printer, there were plenty of other people who were
allowed
        to<br>
        use his computer, including Tom.<br>
        She returned her attention to the letter: You will show this
letter to
        no<br>
        one, nor will you tell anyone about it. On December 23, at 3:00
PM, you<br>
        will go to the Deluxe Motel on Highway 63 in Moberly. You will go
to Room<br>
        36 and knock at the door, and when it opens you will enter. I will
be<br>
        waiting for you inside. This had to be from Tom or Brian - but
which one?<br>
        She looked over the letter again for clues, examined the wrapping
paper,<br>
        studied the package itself. That was one of the problems of being
involved<br>
        with two guys who happened to be roommates, she realized - this
could
        have<br>
        come from either of them and there was damned little to tell her
which
        one.<br>
        Even if she recalled seeing a roll of duct-tape on Tom's desk (and
she<br>
        thought that perhaps she did), that didn't mean that Brian hadn't
borrowed<br>
        the tape to use on the package. She sighed and read on: You will
now open<br>
        the attached package. You will need scissors or a knife to cut the
twine.<br>
        Sarah took perverse satisfaction in cutting the twine with
nail-clippers,<br>
        just to spite the mysterious letter-writer. She ripped off the
wrapping<br>
        paper and opened the box, a large boot-box closed with scotch
tape. Hmm,<br>
        Brian sometimes wore boots - but if he had an extra box lying
around,
        Tom<br>
        could easily have taken it.<br>
        Damn! Inside the box were items of powder-blue lingerie - more
proof that<br>
        it was from someone that knew her well. A casual acquaintance (or
a<br>
        stranger ...) might have chosen jade green to complement her
creamy skin
        and<br>
        red-auburn hair, but only an intimate would know that the blue
would<br>
        actually go better with her sapphire eyes. You will try on the
enclosed<br>
        items now. If any do not fit, you will exchange them for identical
items
        at<br>
        the Victoria's Secret store in Moberly. You will wear these items
when
        you<br>
        come to the Deluxe Motel on December 23. Sarah took the items out
of the<br>
        box one at a time - there was a satin- soft Miracle Bra, but
someone had<br>
        altered it with scissors, cutting away the material so that it
would support<br>
        her breasts but leave her nipples and most of her breasts exposed.
She<br>
        looked closer and saw that the cut edge had been tacked down with
simple<br>
        stitches to avoid a ragged appearance - she wondered if either
Brian or
        Tom<br>
        knew how to sew? The next item was a loose silk camisole top, with
buttons<br>
        down the front. Then came a tiny pair of panties, almost a
g-string. Then<br>
        a garter belt, with stockings. Then a half-slip, slit up the side
almost
        to<br>
        the waist. Sarah slowly undressed and carefully laid her dress,
pantyhose,<br>
        bra, half-slip and panties on the bed.<br>
        Then she put on the items from the box. Everything fit perfectly.<br>
        Smoothing the silky camisole over her breasts, she enjoyed the
feel of
        the<br>
        silk over her bare nipples. She reached down to gently caress her
pubic<br>
        mound, then pressed her fingers lower to feel the wetness already
seeping<br>
        from her pussy to dampen the new panties. She sat down on the bed
to<br>
        continue her reading: With the items from the box, you will wear a
blue<br>
        skirt and blouse and matching shoes. I know that you have these.
You will<br>
        also wear a simple strand of pearls - no other jewelry. When you
enter<br>
        Room 36, the lights will be out. You will take two steps straight
into
        the<br>
        room, and stop with your eyes closed. The door will shut behind
you, and<br>
        the lock will click. You will stand and wait while I tie a folded
silk<br>
        scarf around your head as a blindfold. Then you will open your
eyes, but<br>
        you will not be able to see anything. I will take your arm and
direct
        you<br>
        to the center of the room, where you will have a clear space to
stand.
        I<br>
        will then take my seat to observe you and enjoy your appearance.
When
        I<br>
        clap my hands, you will turn, slowly, so that I can see all of
you. You<br>
        will continue turning, slowly, until the music starts. The music
will
        be<br>
        slow and sensuous, so that you will not need too much room to
dance. As
        you<br>
        dance, you will remove your clothing, one item at time. You will
start
        with<br>
        your shoes, and kick them aside so that you do not trip over them
while<br>
        dancing. Next you will unbutton your blouse, and toss it aside.
The skirt<br>
        will go next, and then the half-slip, so that I can enjoy seeing
your
        legs.<br>
        You will dance like that for awhile, moving slowly, swaying from
side
        to<br>
        side, and running your hands over your body as you dance. Then you
will<br>
        unbutton the camisole, slowly, one button at a time, and then
shrug it
        off<br>
        to the floor. You will continue to dance until the music stops.
Sarah<br>
        noticed that she was getting warm, although she was barely
dressed. She
        was<br>
        holding the letter in one hand, while the other hand caressed
first one<br>
        nipple, then the other, then slid down to rub the folds of her
pussy.
        When<br>
        the music stops I will clap my hands again, and you will turn to
face
        toward<br>
        me. You will unsnap the garters and hook your thumbs in the
waistband
        of<br>
        the panties. Then you will push the panties down your thighs, down
your<br>
        calves, to your ankles. You will then stop, and you will remain
bent over<br>
        in this position while I stroll around the room and inspect you to
my
        own<br>
        satisfaction. When I clap again, you will remove the panties and
stand
        up.<br>
        I will guide you back wards to be seated on one of the beds. Once
seated,<br>
        you will begin to masturbate while I watch you. You will rub and
pull
        your<br>
        nipples with your finger-tips. You will run your hands up and down
your<br>
        body, including your legs. You will tease yourself, first rubbing
your<br>
        mound, then your labia. Finally you will slip one finger inside.<br>
        I'm sure you will be thoroughly wet by this time; you will raise
your
        finger<br>
        to your mouth and suck off your juices. You will return your hand
to your<br>
        pussy and stroke your labia, then open yourself to gently tickle
your<br>
        clitoris. Then you will masturbate yourself to orgasm while I
watch -
        you<br>
        may touch yourself in whatever way is necessary to achieve this
goal.
        Once<br>
        you have achieved orgasm you will turn over to lie face down, with
the
        upper<br>
        half of your body resting on the bed. You will stand with your
legs<br>
        straight, so that your ass is raised while your face and bosom are
pressed<br>
        against the bed. I will secure your wrists to the bedframe with a
twisted<br>
        silk rope to make sure that you do not move from this position.
You will<br>
        remain in this position, not moving, while I have my way with you
as my
        whim<br>
        dictates. I may sit on the floor beneath you to eat your wet cunt,
teasing<br>
        you with tiny strokes of my tongue all around your labia before
moving<br>
        inwards to allow you some satisfaction. I may press my hard cock
into
        your<br>
        pussy; you will feel it going in, slowly, slowly, all the way, and
then<br>
        withdrawing just as slowly, until I decide to pull out of you and
move
        on.<br>
        I may kneel on the bed, and allow you enough slack in your ropes
that
        you<br>
        can raise your head and take my cock into your mouth. You will
suck my<br>
        prick, using your tongue and lips to satisfy me to the best of
your ability,<br>
        until I choose to withdraw. When I have amused myself in this
manner as<br>
        long as I please, your ropes will be unfastened so that you can
turn over
        on<br>
        the bed, lying face up, with your hips at the edge of the bed and
your
        feet<br>
        resting on the floor. I may choose to fuck you again in this
position,
        or<br>
        to delve into your pussy with my fingers or tongue. I may choose
to let
        you<br>
        suck me again. And then I will mount the bed and kneel over you,
letting
        my<br>
        balls graze your stomach while the tip of my prick probes between
your<br>
        lovely breasts. I will wet my fingers in your pussy, and smear
your juices<br>
        on my prick and the inner surfaces between your tits. At this time
you<br>
        will use both hands to press your boobs together, and I will fuck
your<br>
        tits with my hard cock. I will occasionally move forward, pressing
my<br>
        prick against your lips, and you will open your mouth and take in
my cock
        to<br>
        wet it with your tongue. I will withdraw and continue to fuck your
tits,<br>
        until I come and spray my jism across your bosom, and neck, and
face,
        giving<br>
        you a liquid pearl necklace to match the strand you already wear.
And
        then,<br>
        only then, perhaps I will remove your blindfold. Or perhaps not.
Sarah<br>
        shivered. Her bare flesh was covered with goosebumps, although the
air
        in<br>
        her room was warm. She looked down - her fingers and panties were
soaked<br>
        with her juices. She would have to wash the panties before the
23rd. But<br>
        should she go? She didn't know for certain that this package and
letter<br>
        were from one of her lovers - what if they were from some psycho
who had<br>
        just guessed her sizes? She stood up and began to remove the new
lingerie.<br>
        She would have to think this over very carefully, between now and
the
        23rd<br>
        ...</p>
      <p>Sarah stopped and looked at the motel door. The brass numerals
&quot;36&quot;
        were<br>
        tacked to the door. She rubbed her sweating palms on her blue
skirt, and<br>
        checked the strand of pearls to make sure they were properly
placed. She<br>
        checked her watch - it was 2:59 PM. She took off her watch and put
it
        in her<br>
        purse, in case it might be considered jewelry. Then she knocked on
the
        door.</p>
