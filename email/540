DOWNLOADABLE GOODIES

.............................................................
InDesign 2.0.2 Update--Revised

This revised version of Adobe InDesign 2.0.2 fixes a number of
installer-related issues that were present in the original
InDesign 2.0.2 update that was available for download December
4-5, 2002. Like the Adobe InDesign 2.0.2 update released last
December, this revised update also addresses several issues
identified in Adobe InDesign 2.0.1.  

The update is available online for all Roman languages for Mac OS
http://information.adobe.com/cgi-bin1/DM/y/eaPN0FfeGA0ECm0FSJT0Al 

NOTE: If you installed the InDesign 2.0.2 update released last
December, and you haven't encountered any installer issues, you
don't need to install the revised update.
