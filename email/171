Dear Friends,

This is a personal thank you to all that responded to "I am being Evicted". 

Your advice was fair, sincere and very helpful. Before I tell you what is in the works, I felt it only fair to fill you in on the whole story.

Back in June we bought a home with contract that is "a lease to own"option. We went with the owners of the house to the Land and Title Company, they filled out a contract. Stating that we "the buyers" would put down a $10,000.00 down payment in Escrow and make a monthly payment of $1,400 which part of that payment would also go into Escrow towards the downpayment. We have until June 2003 to find a mortgage company that will purchase the contract. (We have credit issues, that we are trying to clear up). Our next stop was the bank where payments were to be made and the loan officer sent the Sellers to the front of the bank to open the Escrow account. Every fine. Two months down the road, the female Seller calls us and wants to know if we have found a mortgage company. I tell her no we are working on clearing up some creditors, but we are working on it. Then she says she wants to make monthly inspections of the house. I told her no problem, even though it's not in the contract, but once every three months. 

Surprise the next day we get an eviction notice, this is in October 2002. I called her up and asked her what the problem was and she said they changed her mind. Okay I am miffed at that point, so I told her that I would need my down payment back, plus the difference of the monthly payments. No problem: Yes there was she informs to tell me that I can't get my money back until they resell the house. I call the lawyer, that's the end of that situation. Make November's payment, December's payment.
December 20th the bank calls, they cannot locate the November payment, $1405.00 cashiers check. They ask me to put a stop payment on the cashier's check. On December 23 I call Seller and tell him what has happened, my bank puts a stop payment and informs the Escrow bank that it will be 30 business days before they will reissue the check. December 24th we get served with eviction papers for non-payment. We sit our children down and tell them what has happened, return ALL the Christmas presents. Call Attorney (my fees are now mounting). Attorney sends letter to court with copy of receipts, court throws it out. 

January comes, payment is due on 1st but we need the next paycheck (because of non paid holidays and money paid to attorney) for Mortgage. Doesn't matter January 2nd, we get another evictions notice, this time they went to the court and posted a $2,000 bond.
This brings everyone up to date.

There is some other matters of concern. The Escrow money (our down payment) was spent by the seller's within the first month of us occupying the house, plus every month the difference that should be in account( a total of $11,200.00). We also believe, but cannot prove that they have come into the house when we have been gone.

WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT IT?

1. I contacted the lawyer?

2. I sent out the letter to you, thanks again for your help,(even if all you let me do was vent). 

Some Suggestions you gave was, call the attorney, pray a lot, give up the house, cyberbeg (I like to earn my money), call certain associations. and so on. Many said you would help to let you know how.

3. I attempted to donate plasma for additional money (my veins are to thin?)

4. We got a court date January 23, 2003

5. Started calling and faxing businesses to bring in more business, so I can pay myself. 

PUT a Plan in place and hope that each one of you can help me with this. 

Here goes: I own a Copy Center, Copy Shack LLC. in Salem, Utah. Below is an insertion of our specials. For those who wanted to help, send this out to everyone you know that is in business of does a lot of copies. Dentists, Stores, students, tupperware representatives, just anyone. Of course what is in the attachement does not include everything we can do, so if they have questions tell them to e-mail me or call. Time is short, but with your help I believe that I can win this battle! Thankx
