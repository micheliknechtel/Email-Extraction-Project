You'd think you couldn't get cheaper than free, yet Microsoft is working hard to compare the business value and total cost of ownership of Windows and Linux. And the new strategy may be working.

Tuesday Software Tech Log: Linux Backlash?         
By Scot Finnie 

It's become fashionable in recent weeks to throw punches at Linux. Giga Information's Rob Enderle did it when he said Linux isn't taking any bites out of Windows (see http://update.techweb.com/cgi-bin4/flo?y=eKIH0BYO6b0CLZ0BpRG0Av ). InformationWeek Research's Outlook 2003 study showed interest in Linux servers down from about 40 percent to 25 percent (see http://update.techweb.com/cgi-bin4/flo?y=eKIH0BYO6b0CLZ0BpRH0Aw ), and emphasis on Windows servers rising over last year by almost 15 percent. Aberdeen Group may have been stating the obvious when it predicted last week that Linux won't move out of the back of the shop onto desktops in 2003 (see http://update.techweb.com/cgi-bin4/flo?y=eKIH0BYO6b0CLZ0BpRI0Ax ). 

Have we become too starry-eyed over Linux? Maybe. Linux appears to be stealing market share from Unix more than from Windows. And let's keep in mind that Novell was a huge player in the LAN server space (and still is). Windows and Linux have both been gobbling market share. It wasn't all that long ago that Microsoft wasn't even considered to be a networking software company.

What's happening is that Linux is becoming accepted. Red Hat is finally in the black. Linux isn't the gee-whiz cause celebre it was a couple years ago. It has stopped being the download of rebellion, and is more and more being looked at for what it is, a tool like any other. That's as it should be.
