Dear Reader,

Thanks to all of you who wrote expressing concern at my getting locked
outside in my nightgown.

Due to a couple of big snowstorms in the past week, I now have a
temporary solution for putting the dog out. The snow in my backyard is
about three feet deep, way over the head of my little dog, so we
shoveled a little playpen in the back yard for her. Now, she can run out
the door and play in her yard, but is unable to go any further.

I don't have to worry about getting stuck in my nightgown any more!=20

Have a great week,
Elizabeth

Dear Computer Lady,


Some time ago I learned how to mute the noise of a dial-up modem.  I had
a problem with my computer and lost everything I had.  I can not
remember for the life of me how to do and have been unable to find the
information anywhere.  Do you happen to know the secret?=20


I know many of your readers as well as myself would be sooooooo happy.

Thanks in advance, Rita

Dear Rita,=20

There are settings for adjusting the modem speaker volume in two places.
For the first one...=20


1) Double click on "My Computer", then on "Control Panel", and then on
"Modems"

2) Make sure the "General" tab is selected on the top of the page, your
modem is highlighted blue, and then click on the "Properties button.

3) On the modem Properties page, click on the "General" tab, and look
for the speaker volume adjustment. Slide the tab all the way to the left
to turn the volume off. Make sure you click "OK" when you are done.

The second place where you can make this adjustment (and I suggest you
check both places) is as follows.

1) Double click on "My Computer", then on "Dial up Networking".

2) Right click on your connection to your Internet Service Provider, and
select properties.

3) On the lower portion of the "General" page, look for the words
"Connect Using" and click on the "Configure" button below your modem
listing.

4) In the middle of the general page, you will see the same speaker
adjustment. Make sure this one is also in the off position.

Elizabeth

Dear Computer Lady,

When logging on to email after entering my ID and password I was asked
if I wanted to save this to automatically sign in, in the future. I
clicked yes before I noticed I made a mistake in my log on ID. Where is
the file saved so I can go and edit the ID?

Thank You, Mike

Dear Mike,

You didn't mention which version of Windows you are using, but in
Windows 95 & 98, just double click on "My Computer" Then on "Dial Up
Networking" and you should see your dial up connection.=20

Double click on your internet connection and a window will come up that
will allow you to make the changes to your password.=20

Once you have changed the password, you need to click the "Connect"
button and successfully connect to the internet once in order for the
change to become permanent.

In Windows XP,=20

Click on "Start", then "Control Panel", then on "Network & Internet
Connections".

In the Network and Internet Connections window, click on "Setup or
change your internet connection". This will bring up your "Internet
Properties" window. Make sure you are on the "Connections" tab and click
on your internet connection, then click on the "Settings" button to the
right.=20

Change your password and then click "OK" twice.

I don't think it is necessary to connect before saving the password in
XP, but I am not 100% sure.

Elizabeth

Dear Computer Lady,

You mentioned that Gator was spyware.  What does this mean because I use
this all the time? Am I more susceptible to hackers or something?

DW

Dear DW,

Spyware is any software which employs a user's Internet connection in
the background without their knowledge or explicit permission, usually
for advertising purposes. Spyware programs are usually bundled as a
hidden component in mis-labeled "freeware" and shareware applications
downloaded from the Internet.

Here is the official definition from whatis.com:

Spyware is any technology that aids in gathering information about a
person or organization without their knowledge. On the Internet, spyware
is programming that is put in someone's computer to secretly gather
information about the user and relay it to advertisers or other
interested parties. Spyware can get in a computer as a software virus or
as the result of installing a new program. Data collecting programs that
are installed with the user's knowledge are not, properly speaking,
spyware, if the user fully understands what data is being collected and
with whom it is being shared.=20

What can you do about spyware?=20

You should use a program to check for spyware that might be currently
installed on your system. Ad-Aware is a great program for this. Ad-aware
is a free multi spyware removal utility that scans your memory, registry
and hard drives for known spyware and scumware components and lets you
remove them safely. You can check out Ad-Aware at:

Are your fans working?=20

I thought to bring up this subject today because of a computer repair I
recently did. I had to replace a motherboard, processor and power supply
in a computer. The motherboard and processor overheated because the fan
in the power supply stopped working. If the problem had been noticed
earlier, all that would have needed replacing was the power supply.

Take a moment and look at the back of your computer. Is there a fan in
the back? If so, is it turning and is air coming out? If the fan has
stopped, or there is no airflow, get it fixed before it leads to bigger
problems.

If you are really brave, open up your case, and check for fans inside
the computer too.

Dear Computer Lady,
=20
I enjoy the "Computer Lady" newsletter.  I am a Supervisor at a large
multi-national computer corporation in Houston, Texas.  I learn new
tidbits from you and get a refresher on some old stuff I had forgotten.
=20
Regarding Drasher using "...Gator for passwords and forms."  I wanted to
mentioned two other password saving options.
=20
1) Robo Form http://www.roboform.com/
Screenshots  http://www.roboform.com/manual.html#passsave
=20
It saves my userid and password information the first time I enter it at
a web site.  Thereafter, it sits in my system tray.  Then it pops up
automatically when I go to a web site it has the information on.  I
click the "FillForms" button and it fills it in for me.
=20
Example: At the Hotmail web site, it captured my userid and password the
first time and let me name it (e.g. Grant's Hotmail, Mom's Hotmail,
etc.).  Now when I am at the Hotmail logon page, it pops up and I click
the "FillForms" button and it fills it in for me.  If I was checking
moms email for her, I click on her name (Mom's Hotmail), then click on
"FillForms" button so it will put in her userid and password.
=20
RoboForm has a lot of other features for more skilled users.  Best of
all it is free.  There are no banner ads or pops ups.
RoboForm Pro ($30) is for advanced and power users.
=20
=20
=20
2) I also use PasswordSafe  http://www.passwordsafe.com/
=20
It is web based and lets me add and access the data from anywhere,
including non-web data, e.g. phone numbers, anniversary dates, web site
accounts, online shopping, online auctions, network, email, Hotmail
password, bookmarks and more. You can keep data in different folders,
e.g. personal, business, social group, church related, etc.  You can
also add a short note about the entry.  In one entry, I noted the
password is the date I created the account, in reverse order (e.g.
create date 01/03/03 reversed to password 303010). The service is free.
There are no banner ads or pops ups.
=20
In addition, you can download HyperSafe.
http://www.passwordsafe.com/hypersafe.html
It lives on your PC.  You tell it to sync with your PasswordSafe account
and it downloads all your data.  With HyperSafe you can look up your
passwords and such without logging onto the PasswordSafe website.  You
can copy and paste the data.  HyperSafe is free.  There are no banner
ads or pops ups.
=20
I use all three.  I have about 187 entries in PasswordSafe/HyperSafe.
=20
Keep up the good work.
