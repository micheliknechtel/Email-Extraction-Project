------------------------------
Jumping to the End without Repaginating
------------------------------
Subscriber Bob Cahill wondered if there is a way to jump to the end of
a document, upon opening, without having the document repaginate. It
seems that the repagination process slows him down a bit, and he is
looking for a way to speed things up.

Before getting into an answer, it should be noted that the
repagination process should only slow a person down if any of three
conditions are met.

   * Slow computer. If the computer is intrinsically slow or has quite
     a few other processes besides Word that are going on behind the
     scenes, then repagination can slow things down.
   * Big document. An extremely long or quite complex document can
     result in slow repagination. Tests show that a straightforward
     600-page document typically takes about three or four seconds to
     repaginate--not a big slowdown. If the document contained lots of
     footnotes, large graphics, hidden text, or other items that
     affect pagination, then the process would take longer.
   * Bad document. If the document is heavily edited and older, then
     repagination can be slower. This apparently occurs after many,
     many intense editing sessions where lots of text is added,
     deleted, and moved around. Sometimes Word's internal document
     pointers can get "messed up."

The solutions to these conditions should be obvious to most readers,
with the possible exception of the "bad document" cause. In this case,
it is best to try to do a Save As to a new file name, or better still,
to copy and paste the information from the old document to a new one.

That being said, if you still want to turn off pagination and jump to
the end, this can be done, with a caveat. The caveat is that you can
only turn off pagination if you are viewing the document in Normal
view. If you switch to another view (Print Layout being the most
common), then Word automatically does repagination and there is no way
to turn it off.

That being said, the following short macro could be used as an
AutoOpen macro for your document. When you open the document, Word
switches to Normal view, turns off background repagination, and jumps
to the end of the document.

     Sub AutoOpen()
         If ActiveWindow.View.Type <> wdNormalView Then
             ActiveWindow.View.Type = wdNormalView
         End If
         Options.Pagination = False
         Selection.EndKey Unit:=wdStory
     End Sub

The Options.Pagination property is the same setting you can make
manually if you choose Tools | Options | General tab and toggle the
Background Repagination check box. This setting of this check box is
only meaningful if Word is operating in Normal view, thus the need to
switch to that view prior to setting the option and jumping.

Remember that if you later do something that requires Word to
repaginate (such as switching to Print Layout view or using the Go To
feature to jump to a particular page number), then Word will dutifully
repaginate your document, introducing the delay you want to avoid.

For completeness you may want to add an AutoClose macro to your
document. This macro does nothing but turn on the background
pagination option so that it will work normally with other documents.

     Sub AutoClose()
         Options.Pagination = True
     End Sub

------------------------------
Extracting INCLUDEPICTURE File Names
------------------------------
When working with long documents that contain graphics, it is not
unusual to use the INCLUDEPICTURE field to actually insert the
graphics into the document. If you have a large number of these fields
in your document, you may want a way to create an "art list" that
includes the names of the graphic files used in the document.

By using a relatively simple macro, you can step through each instance
of the INCLUDEPICTURE field in your document and extract just the
names of the files referenced. These can then be added to a new
document, so that when the macro is done, the new document contains
just a list of the files referenced in the INCLUDEPICTURE fields. Here
is a macro that will do just this:

     Sub GetIncludePictures()
         Dim oField As Field
         Dim oCurrentDoc As Document
         Dim oNewDoc As Document
         Dim sFileName As String
     
         Set oCurrentDoc = ActiveDocument
         Set oNewDoc = Application.Documents.Add
     
         For Each oField In oCurrentDoc.Fields
             If oField.Type = wdFieldIncludePicture Then
                 sFileName = Replace(oField.Code, "INCLUDEPICTURE", "")
                 sFileName = Replace(sFileName, "MERGEFORMAT", "")
                 sFileName = Replace(sFileName, "\*", "")
                 sFileName = Replace(sFileName, "\d", "")
                 sFileName = Replace(sFileName, Chr(34), "")
                 sFileName = Replace(sFileName, "\\", "\")
                 sFileName = Trim(sFileName)
                 oNewDoc.Range.InsertAfter sFileName & vbCrLf
             End If
         Next oField
     
         oNewDoc.Activate
     
         Set oField = Nothing
         Set oCurrentDoc = Nothing
         Set oNewDoc = Nothing
     End Sub

Notice the use of the Replace function several times in the macro.
This function replaces occurrences of one string within another string
with other text. That may sound confusing, but it is very handy. As an
example, imagine that you have a string (sMyString) that contains the
characters "This is my string", and that you use the following:

     SMyString = Replace(sMyString, "s", "X")

This results in every lowercase "s" in sMyString being replaced with
an uppercase "X". The result is that sMyString will now contain "ThiX
iX my Xtring".

In the case of the GetIncludePictures macro, the several lines that
contain Replace functions work to remove all the extraneous characters
from the field code, except for the actual file name of the picture.
If you want something else removed, as well, you can add more lines to
remove those elements. (For instance, if you wanted to remove a
standard path name to where your pictures are stored.)

When the macro is done running, the only thing in the new document
should be the name of pictures, as in the following examples:

     C:\mypics\picture1.tif
     ..\graphics\chap01\fig03.gif

If you wanted just the file names, and not the full path names, you
could modify the GetIncludePictures macro a bit to include code that
parsed out the path. You could do this by adding the following to the
macro, just after the line sFileName = Trim(sFileName):

     While Instr(sFileName, "\") > 0
         sFileName = Mid(sFileName, Instr(sFileName, "\") + 1)
     Wend

------------------------------
Changing the Attached Template
------------------------------
In Word, a template is used to specify the menu options, the toolbar,
and the default styles and text. When you first open a blank document,
Word automatically attaches the Normal.Dot template to your document,
although you can specify a different template. After the file has been
created, you can change the attached template by following these
steps:

   1. Select Templates and Add-Ins from the Tools menu. Word displays
      the Templates and Add-Ins dialog box.
   2. Click on the Attach button. Word displays the Attach Template
      dialog box.
   3. Use the controls in the dialog box to locate and select the
      template you want attached to your document.
   4. Click on Open. The Attach Template dialog box disappears, and
      the name of the template you selected appears in the Document
      Template box.
   5. Select the Automatically Update Document Styles check box to
      make sure that the styles in the template are applied to your
      document.
   6. Click on OK.


------------------------------
Selecting a Word
------------------------------
If you are using a mouse, Word provides a shortcut to select an entire
word. To do this, follow these two steps:

   1. Using the mouse pointer, point to the word you want to select.
   2. Double-click on the mouse.

If you want to select additional words, hold down the mouse button
after the second click and drag the mouse across them. Word adds one
word at a time to your selection. Once the words are selected, you can
do any other editing function on those words.

Controlling Font Classification
------------------------------
I use Office 2000 for both Hebrew and English. When I install Hebrew
TrueType fonts in Windows, they automatically integrate with Word, but
Word erroneously assigns them as "Latin Text Fonts," rather than
"Complex Text Fonts." When I try to use these fonts for writing in
Hebrew, I cannot. How do I force Word to recognize a particular font
as Hebrew, when it insists that it is a "Latin Text Font?" (Benzy
Shani)


------------------------------
Toggling Font Assignments in a Macro
------------------------------
I created a macro for a toolbar button to format Times Roman text to
be Arial Narrow Bold text. But what I now want to do, is make that
same button a toggle button to turn the Arial Narrow Bold text back
to Times Roman unbold. Any suggestions? (Jacie Wedberg)
