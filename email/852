LETTER FROM THE EDITOR

Hello again everyone!

How are you doing, keeping your New Year's resolution? If you're 
having trouble, ask yourself "What are my motivations to quit?"

The first and most important reason is to do it for your own 
health and wellness. We all have this responsibility--to 
maintain our own health. But look at other motivations and let 
them propel you.

I was conducting some business at the bank the other day. The 
teller saw the name of the company. "Quit smoking?" she asked 
curiously. I briefly explained about the business. Then she said 
"I told my boyfriend I wouldn't marry him unless he quit 
smoking. We've been married five years now."

What a motivator! He obviously loved her and cared more about 
her than smoking. I told her "I wish I could bottle that and 
sell it!"

What do you care more about than smoking? How about seeing your 
grandchildren grow up? Or being more attractive to the opposite 
sex? Or protecting your unborn child? Or what about more money 
in your pocket? Today's article touches on the money issue.

Get clear about why you want to quit. Make sure these are 
stronger reasons than why you want to smoke.

+++

Today's article is by a guest author, Mark Brennaman. It's one 
man's lament, and story of ongoing struggle and triumph, told 
with tongue slightly in cheek, and cigarette hopefully not!

GUEST ARTICLE: I Could Have Been a Millionaire
By Mark Brennaman

The way I figure, I could have $1,817,351.54 in the bank right 
now, but I chose to enrich poor ol' Phillip Morris instead. I've 
been smoking cigarettes for longer than I care to mention here. 
When I was young my parents smoked Pall Malls and I'd sneak a 
couple out of their packs to try them out. I eventually became 
mesmerized by the Marlboro Man, and wanted to be just like him -
- except for the part where he dies of lung cancer.

This huge sum of money was calculated by conservatively 
estimating how many packs of cigarettes I've purchased in my 
lifetime. I then estimated how the price of cigarettes has 
steadily gone up over the years. (I remember once proclaiming, 
"When cigarettes go up to 75 cents a pack, I'm quitting." Today, 
a pack costs me $3.51). Next, I calculated the balance had I 
deposited the money in a bank and let compound interest do its 
magic.

Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda

I could have done a lot of neat things with $1.8 million. I 
could have invested it in Enron and been as broke as I am now, 
but at least my heart and lungs would be healthy.

I could have purchased a mansion and made all my guests go 
outside to smoke, or blown it all for a night or two in the 
Lincoln Bedroom a few years back. Or, I could have donated it to 
George W. Bush, Jr.'s campaign and spent four years as 
ambassador to the Bahamas.

My clothes wouldn't smell of stale tobacco, and my skin would 
not have yellowed and taken on a Keith Richards-like appearance.

I should have known better. The Surgeon General issued his first 
warning about the health effects of tobacco before I even took 
up the habit. I should have quit when my mother died of cancer 
long ago.

Despite all that, I bought pack after pack of one of the highest 
tar and nicotine-laden brands going -- Marlboro Reds. And I was 
a professional smoker at that. I'd even wake up in the middle of 
the night to smoke a cigarette or two since the puffs in my 
dreams just didn't satisfy my need for more nicotine.

Several years back, I found myself in intensive care and was 
really upset at the nurse for not bringing me cigarettes. She 
had promised to take care of my craving. What kind of service 
was this? I was on anesthetic drugs from my surgery, but still 
conscious enough to explain things to my sister: "The nurse is 
going to bring me a box to put over my head so I can smoke."

When I woke up the next day in a regular hospital room I found 
that the nurse had put a nicotine patch on my arm. Powerful 
stuff, nicotine! I wanted to rip it off my arm, roll it up and 
smoke it, but the nurse wouldn't give me a lighter.

I'm A Quitter

Quitting smoking has been a struggle for me and I blame this on 
my school teachers. They taught me that winners never quit and 
quitters never win. Of course, they weren't talking about 
smoking, but how was I to know?"

I've tried to quit so many times I consider myself an expert -- 
at not quitting. Of course, my attempts to quit never lasted. 
The nicotine would finally nag my brain and nervous system until 
I'd buy another pack and gleefully light up. But now I'm 
determined to be a quitter, once and for all.

This time I'm going to kick butt, as in cigarette butts. I've 
got a prescription for Zyban™ and have the first month's supply 
of Habitrol™ step-down nicotine patches. I've also got a burning 
desire to rid my body of all the carbon monoxide, tar, nicotine 
and the other 142 toxic chemicals that make up what we call a 
smoked cigarette.
