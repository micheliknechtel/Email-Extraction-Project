Writers' Words of the Week:
        
       "Becoming the reader is the essence of becoming a 
       writer."
                                          -- John O'Hara

Writers' Tip of the Week: Writing for Readers

Seems kind of obvious, doesn't it? You write with the 
expectation that somebody, somewhere, will read it. But, do you 
keep the reader in mind when you write? If you do, you'll
produce copy that's easy to read. That doesn't mean writing 
about easy topics. Anybody can understand quantum physics if 
it's explained right.

Instead, approach a topic with your readers in mind. What will 
they want to know? If you're not sure, then you don't know your 
potential readers. Many writers picture a reader in their minds 
and write as if they were telling the story to that person.

Beyond word choice, you should also think about how the reader
will read your story. Long paragraphs, with five or six complex 
sentences and more than one central idea, are hard to navigate 
and intimidating for many readers. 

With a long story, the reader might get lost in the narrative 
before he comes out at the other end. Break it into a central
narrative with three or four sidebars, associated smaller stories 
that allow you to expand on an idea or introduce a related idea 
without getting in the way of the main story.
