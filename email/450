************************************
1)  Coliseum? We Call 'Em as We See 'Em! Some Sporting Packages to
Rome for As Low As $100/Night Including Air

Wintertime Rome is a lot warmer than many other celebrated European
cities in that season.  Temperatures usually hover in the 50s, and
rainfall is around three inches a month.  Bearing that city's
agreeable weather history in mind (and having just rented Gladiator),
we present these well-priced excursions to the Eternal City, which are
good for the next few months.  Each supplies you with airfare and a
hotel, and then allows you to do the exploring on your own.

2)  Kids Fly Free & Ski Free, and a Few Other Slope-Happy Promotions
from Southwest Vacations

For Monday and Tuesday departures to Salt Lake City between December
12 and 19 and January 2 and 30, staying two nights at the Crystal Inn
Downtown, Southwest Vacations offers some fairly decent pricing.

***********************************
3)  A Renaissance for Renaissance Cruises: One of Our Budget Faves
Changes Its Policies for the Better, but Is Still Offering Some of the
Best Rates Around. How about $699 for 12 Nights in the Mediterranean

Today's deal is an especially nifty offer. For the March 10th and 22nd
sailings of the R1 and R7, Renaissance will be offering an $800
discount off the published rate for Category H inside cabins. That
sale rate is just $699 per person (based on double occupancy) for a
12-night cruise between Istanbul and Piraeus (for Athens). To that
you'll have to add fees and taxes of about $230, but the combined rate
still stands as a bargain, especially for Europe's high priced waters.
(European cruises are always much pricier than Caribbean ones).

4)  Road Trip! Hit the Road This Spring With AmeriCan and Roadrunner's
Panoply of Tours!

Traveling in comfortable vans and sleeping in tents, dozens upon
dozens of 13-person groups will be following one the thirty-two North
American road trip itineraries that the folks at AmeriCan Adventures
and Roadrunner have concocted. Catering to a younger crowd, the
AmeriCan division of the company offers the more adventurous
trips--twenty-five in all--covering every region of the United States,
Canada, and Alaska.  Taking you both to big cities and to the great
outdoors, AmeriCan's tours make use of a variety of campsites (with
shower/toilet facilities) and as well as city center hotels.  Although
you need to bring your own sleeping bag (or purchase one from
AmeriCan), you needn't know a thing about camping; camping novices
form the majority of each 13 person trip, and tour leads take the
first day to teach travelers how to erect their heavy duty tents
(designed for four people but used by only two).

5)  Letters to the Editor: Kudos for the Carriers! Only the Good News
in This Week's Airlines Forum

To the Editor:

I have always been very curious about JetBlue since first reading
about the new airline.  My wife and I had our first opportunity to fly
from Orlando to New York JFK to connect with an overseas carrier.  I
mentioned to the travel agent I was curious about JetBlue and she
stated she had little experience with the airline.   We booked with
JetBlue and my wife and I both can say that this is a first class
airline with clean, customer friendly aircraft.   The staff was
excellent on both legs of the flight and offer a level of service that
other larger carriers should take time to look at. My wife and I are
both 6 ft. tall and we had ample leg room.  The leather seating and on
board TV allow for the flight to pass quickly.

I encourage anyone who hasn't tried JetBlue to try it.  You won't go
back to the cramped seating that you experience on other airlines.
