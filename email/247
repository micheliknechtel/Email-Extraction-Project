Hello, Friend.

   This issue is all about money. Last week we asked you whether
   ministries should accept offerings that come from Lottery
   winnings. Now comes the news that the Salvation Army refused
   such a gift of $100,000. Read the story and check out the
   results of our poll.

   Also in this issue--

   * Gordon MacDonald shares from his journal. Am I my brother's
     keeper? What about his SUV? Gordon seems to be feeling
     strongly the responsibility we Christians bear for others,
     both for their faith and their physical well being.

   * How five churches are helping people get out of debt and
     manage their money.

   * And another view on "Good to Great" from a pastor who wants
     to be a Level 5 leader.

   Until next week,
   Eric Reed
   Leadership Managing Editor

LEADER'S INSIGHT

   MY BROTHER'S KEEPER'S SUV
   by Gordon MacDonald, editor-at-large

   From my journal: An interesting comment by novelist Paul
   Theroux: "There is always a shiver of satisfaction that the
   smugly voyeuristic public feels when marginal people kill each
   other, when a boxer dies from a lethal punch, or when the
   corpse of the unwelcome boat person is revealed by the ebbing
   tide. It is the rush of the spectator at a cockfight, for the
   faceless struggler has not character beyond his struggle, no
   personality, and all anyone cares about is the outcome--the
   loser is indistinguishable from the winner. Mexican farm
   workers suffocating to death in a box car, prison inmates
   clawing each other to death, vengeful mobsters, furious gays--
   such murders arouse little emotion. You don't feel that their
   distress places you in any personal danger. They asked for
   it."

   I don't like Theroux's observation because it is too close to
   a truth I see in myself. How little I have ever heard about
   the words of Cain, "Am I my brother's keeper?" I guess, from a
   Biblical standpoint, I am--my brother's keeper. Then how do I
   keep my soul properly sensitive to the suffering in the world
   today? The anguish, the misfortune of enemies as well as
   friends?

   A Biblical passage to examine the state of one's soul:
   Revelation 3:14-22. Ah, Laodecia! The place where so-called
   Christians were neither hot nor cold (passionless, I guess),
   thought they were rich and independent, and boasted that they
   were well-clothed and healthy. Jesus has a different
   perspective; read it if you've forgotten. And then he reminds
   them--and us--that he's always knocking.

   How many ways will Jesus knock on the door of my life today?
   It sure makes a wonderful sermon. I tried preaching it the
   other day. Don't know what it did for the folks in the pews,
   but it sure stung me.

   I don't like Laodecians; guess I'll move to Corinth.

   New books I'm absorbing:  Donald Spoto's Reluctant Saint
   (Viking/Compass), the latest biography of St. Francis. It is
   an excellent treatment of a man in Christian history that I
   think is going to mark the 21st century. Francis understood
   things about thinking like, acting like, and serving like
   Jesus that few understand today.

   Chris Seay's The Gospel According to Tony Soprano
   (Archer/Putnam). Admission: I swallowed hard when I first
   opened it. And swallowed hard a few more times when I felt
   that Chris Seay was reaching to make some of his points. But
   he sure made me think. And ask some hard questions. It's been
   a great read.

   Barbara Ehrenreich's Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting by in
   America. I can't look at another minimum-wage worker the same
   way again after reading this thoroughly engaging book. Somehow
   I feel as if I'm reading about the people with whom Jesus
   would have spent most of his time.

   Something that bothers me: News articles about folks who have
   found a loophole in the tax laws that encourages them to buy
   huge, expensive SUVs because of the incredible tax break (20-
   25% of the SUV's cost apparently). When interviewed, these
   guys say, "I can't afford not to buy one!" And so they do and
   drain off just a bit more of the energy that our grandchildren
   and great-children will never see. Is it Christian to be
   bothered about something like this? Do I come off appearing
   this selfish to people who aren't as well off as me? Just
   asking.

   From an older book on my shelves: "We have not advanced very
   far in our spiritual lives if we have not encountered the
   basic paradox of freedom, to the effect that we are most free
   when we are bound. But not just any way of being bound will
   suffice; what matters is the character of our binding.
   "The one who would like to be an athlete, but who is unwilling
   to discipline his body by regular exercise and by abstinence,
   is not free to excel on the field or the tracks. His failure
   to train rigorously and to live abstemiously denies him the
   freedom to go over the bar at the desired height, or to run
   with the desired speed and endurance.

   "With one concerted voice the giants of the devotional life
   apply the same principle for the whole of life with the
   dictum: Discipline is the price of freedom."

   Elton Trueblood in New Man for our Time

   I had to write it down and think about it:  "Christians who
   can't or won't share their faith with others may be in a
   crisis of faith of their own. The question is whether they
   believe in the efficacy of the gospel--the gospel which
   justified so that we don't need to earn our status before God
   or vie for position with others; the gospel which gives shape
   and purpose to live, making us other-directed rather than
   self-centered; the gospel of peace which reconciles broken
   relationships and builds community; the gospel of justice
   which advocates for the poor and the marginalized. This is
   good news. So how can one keep from sharing it?" (from the
   Leadership Network, first published in Christian Century,
   11/20/02)

ILLUSTRATION OF THE WEEK

   In a sermon on giving, Dave Ferguson, pastor of Community
   Christian Church in Naperville, Illinois, read this letter
   from Jeff and Julie, who attend the church:

   Julie and I started attending Community Christian Church in
   January 1993, after moving here from California.

   We moved here for a business opportunity that ended up not
   working out, and we soon found ourselves in a desperate
   financial situation. We were behind in our rent and our car
   payments. We had back-IRS payments, 16 credit cards with more
   than $40,000 in debt, and not enough food in the fridge to
   keep our tummies full. And on top of all that, we decided to
   start a business.

   Well, in the middle of this, Jon had challenged us to include
   our finances in our commitment to following Jesus, and I
   really struggled with this. It wasn't that I didn't want to
   support CCC or set an example for others to follow. It was, in
   fact, that on occasion Julie and I were so broke that we ended
   up going to a friend's restaurant to ask for free food. I
   thought, If I'm struggling to keep my family, how can I commit
   what I don't have to God? What am I supposed to do? just write
   a check for ten percent of my income and hope that something
   happens? Jon urged me to trust God and give it a shot.

   After prayer and discussion, we decided that God would get the
   first portion of every check and not just what we were willing
   to give up each week. We learned to make God the first
   priority in our lives, and we had no idea how we'd get by.

   During the week after this decision, my brother and I were
   dropping off flyers at a construction site looking for work.
   We'd started a carpentry company. We met a builder, and he
   asked if we would be interested in doing their work. He had a
   house that was ready for us to start immediately and about
   twenty more to do during the next twelve months.

   Julie and I no longer questioned how we'd honor our financial
   commitment. Julie and I decided to increase our giving.

   If our story ended there, it would be a good story. However,
   you cannot outgive God. Over the next couple of years through
   a complicated and divinely orchestrated series of events,
   Julie and I also went from renters to homeowners. Owning a
   home has given us the ability to restructure our debt and
   gives us some security and stability. I felt the need to tell
   our story. The story is about much, much more than finances.
   It's about faith, stepping out and trusting God with all that
   we have--our lives, our future, our relationship, and even our
   finances.

   Now as I reflect on this story and what we experienced, I'm
   still trying to answer one question. What was it that we
   sacrificed?

   in Naperville, Illinois, from sermon "Here Is My Investment
   Strategy"
