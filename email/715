LAFF A DAY - Wednesday, January 08, 2003

Greetings Laff Lovers,

Have you ever had gas that would peel the paint off the walls?
I’m talking about gas so thick and dense that it could be
bottled and sold as an industrial solvent.

Yesterday I went to White Castle for lunch. They wreak havoc
on my stomach but you really can’t beat the taste of those
slimy, little burgers. Then, when I went home for dinner my
wife produced a pot of steaming split pea soup.

"Oh, man," I muttered, "you’re gonna kill me with this stuff.
I had Whities for lunch and now this."

"Oh, be thankful and eat," was my wife’s reply.

Fast forward to 6:30 A.M. the next morning. I woke up choking
from the stench of the gas my intestines had produced.

"Hey, Honey, wake up," I said nudging my wife. "It’s time for
you to be thankful for my diet," I said fanning the covers.

"AAARRRGGGHHH!" she screamed running out of the room.

I laughed, got up and jumped in the shower. When I got out my
two daughters were walking into the room.

My seven-year-old waved a hand in front of her face. "What
STINKS?!"

My four-year-old sniffed the air and said, "Is Mama making
pancakes?"

I grabbed them and hurried them out of the room before they
became toxic. "No. Mama only made half that smell--White Castle
made the rest."

Noxiously,

TZ

The new Vicar was up early one Sunday morning, walking 
round his new parish, after leaving his wife in bed with the 
Sunday papers, her cup of tea, and a pack of cigarettes.

One of the old villagers came up to him and said. "Good 
morning Vicar, how be you and the wife?"

The Vicar said, "Good morning my man, I am fine, the wife is 
fine also as I left her in bed smoking."

The villager said, "Arr, Vicar, that's the way to fuck 'em!"



A man went to the doctor complaining of insomnia. The doctor
gave him a thorough examination, found absolutely nothing 
physically wrong with him, and then told him, "Listen, if 
you ever expect to cure your insomnia, you just have to 
stop taking your trouble to bed with you." 

"I know" said the man, "but I can't. My wife refuses to 
sleep alone."

A lot of times when they catch a guy who killed twenty-seven
people, they say, "He was a loner." Well, of course he was a
loner; he killed everyone he came in contact with.

If JFK Jr. got into a taxi in New York to go to the airport,
do you think he would say, "Take me to JFK?" How would he feel
about that? And how does Lee Harvey Oswald’s mother feel when
she walks through JFK, knowing that if she had stayed single
it would probably be Martin Luther King Jr. Airport?

An elderly couple was visiting New York's fashion district 
when the wife noticed her husband staring at the models in 
their short skirts and revealing blouses. 

"Henry," his wife said, "stop that!  You look like you've 
never seen a woman's legs or breasts before!"

"You know," he replied somewhat sadly, "I was just thinking 
the exact same thing myself."



The attractive young thing was about to go to bed with her 
blind date when she burst into tears.

"I'm afraid you'll get the wrong idea about me," she said 
between sobs. "I'm really not that kind of girl!"

"I believe ya," her date said, as he tried to comfort her.

"You're the first one," she gulped.

"The first one to make love to you?" he asked.

"No!" she replied. "The first one to believe me."
