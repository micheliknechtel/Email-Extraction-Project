STARVE THEM OUT?

President Bush has made two statements on the matter of 
food and hunger. The first was that Kim Jong Il of North 
Korea has opted for national hunger by his single-minded 
policies aimed at weapons production. Mr. Bush is correct: 
Thirty percent of the gross domestic product of North 
Korea goes into the military. It was so in the Soviet 
Union, which dragooned 30 percent and more of its 
productive resources into the military, resulting in 
widespread misery.

The second statement Mr. Bush made is arresting. He was 
talking now about U.S. food shipments to North Korea. 
"We've got a great heart, but I have no heart for some-
body who starves his folks." There's a mixture of real-
politik and Christian concern here, and the two need 
lives independent from each other.

It is undeniable that the poverty of North Korea translates 
to a shortage of food. And no one denies that the United 
States has been perhaps the primary food supplier for a 
nation in distress. But fastmoving events involving North 
Korea leave the Bush administration clinging to mutually 
exclusive propositions. The first is that one should feed 
people who are starving. The second, that we must retaliate 
against the North Korean decision to pursue the production 
of nuclear bombs.

Last summer, when we satisfied ourselves that the North 
Koreans were violating their commitments of 1994, the U.S. 
led a movement to suspend shipments of oil to Pyongyang. 
That oil had been our part of the 1994 bargain, on which 
Kim had defaulted. The oil-shipment freeze has worked the 
hardships intended, and they necessarily include the 
diminution of food production, and therefore more 
privation.

But it is now contemplated to increase the pressure by 
actively discouraging not merely oil, but grain. This 
leaves Mr. Bush with responsibility for enhancing 
starvation in North Korea, and this appears to run against 
the moral grain. Granted, the United States has never 
undertaken to feed every country in the world that is 
short of food, but to withhold grain as a matter of 
policy is something more merely than the question of 
acknowledging that in many countries food is scarce.

Now outgoing South Korean President Kim Dae Jung has 
contributed the following: "Pressure and isolation have 
never been successful with communist countries, even 
during the Cold War." That is mostly correct, though 
isolation did serve to subdue Rhodesia, which, left alone, 
might have proceeded more slowly toward liberation by 
Mugabe. The attempt at economic sanctions against the 
Soviet Union did not work, but the Soviet enterprise
was on a scale that doesn't greatly illuminate the 
problem of North Korea, whose 22 million people are 
more directly susceptible to economic strangulation.

So Mr. Bush has to straighten that out. Do we believe that 
a steady attrition in the food supply of North Korea will 
bring about a closing of the facilities engaged in 
enriching uranium? In straight-out wars, we happily engage 
in blockades. If it had been established in the fall of 
1944 that more and more Germans were starving, we'd have 
put this down as a great achievement. Starving people to 
death is slower than bombing them to death, but still, it 
would have meant fewer Nazis to contend with.

But we are not at war with North Korea, and for that 
reason need to apply toward it different policy criteria.
And here we have the growing disparity between the counsel 
of the South Korean public and that of U.S. hard-liners. 
The South Koreans are moving toward ambivalence about 
the continuing U.S. role, which has dominated policy on 
the peninsula for a half-century. Protests against us 
mount, and the incoming president, Roh Moon Hyun, is an 
accommodationist who seems to want merely to live another 
day, and this is understandable inasmuch as the North 
Koreans, without using a nuclear weapon, could wipe out 
a quarter-million people in Seoul with a single fusillade 
from standing artillery.

Ah, and among that quarter-million are American soldiers. 
We have 37,000 of them in South Korea, strategic holdovers
from when we fought hand-to-hand with the North Koreans to 
save the South. Is it wise to leave U.S. military there, 
at point-blank range of the North Koreans? Or will the new 
government in the South consider the presence of U.S. 
troops a part of the infrastructure of such security as 
they continue to have, against a North Korea starving for 
food and covetous of the exercise of power?
