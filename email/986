                MSNBC Chat Mailing List
------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Tuesday MSNBC.com Chat Newsletter. MSNBC e-mails this =
feature Monday through Friday to remind you of scheduled guest chat =
events so you can submit your questions for the newsmakers and other =
interesting people we interview.  We also provide alerts on the topics =
most heavily discussed in News Chat.

Today at 12 Noon ET

Despite the advances brought about by the passage of the Americans with =
Disabilities act, there are still many challenges facing travelers with =
disabilities. Which cruise ships are truly accessible? How can one rent =
scooters, oxygen and other necessities on the road? Which destinations =
cater to wheelchair-bound vacationers? Which are best for slow walkers? =
Joan Diamond, an expert of travel for persons with disabilities, will =
answer all of your questions concerning modes of travel, best =
destinations, specialized travel companies and more.  Questions can be =
submitted ahead of time through the chat page at http://Chat.MSNBC.com

NEWSCHAT UPDATE

Some of the stories being discussed by our chatters this morning:

U.N. weapons inspectors took to the air Tuesday in their search for =
evidence of banned weapons, using helicopters for the first time as they =
began their seventh week in Iraq.  http://www.msnbc.com/news/842500.asp

Israeli troops exchanged fire with Palestinian militiamen for four hours =
early Tuesday, killing three gunmen before withdrawing from the =
outskirts of a refugee camp, witnesses said.  =
http://www.msnbc.com/news/801833.asp

Among those who go online to catch up on politics, almost half of =
Republicans, 46 percent, said they like to register their opinions in =
online surveys.  Fewer than three in 10 Democrats, 28 percent, said they =
like to participate in the online surveys, according to the poll by the =
Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, in cooperation with the =
Pew Internet and American Life Project. =
http://www.msnbc.com/news/855213.asp

A defiant North Korea said Tuesday that economic sanctions over its =
nuclear program would "mean a war" and that the United States should sit =
down for talks to resolve the standoff.  =
http://www.msnbc.com/news/850567.asp

NBC's Robert Windrem explains in his Spy Scope Weblog that the Korean =
Central News Agency sees James Bond as a symbol of U.S. hostility toward =
North Korea. http://spyscope.msnbc.com

President Bush put forward a "growth and jobs" economic stimulus plan on =
Tuesday that would accelerate income tax rate cuts for millions of =
Americans, wipe out all federal taxes on stock dividends and boost the =
child care tax credit by $400 per child to aid an estimated 34 million =
American families. The administration estimated its latest economic =
stimulus package would carry a 10-year price tag of $674 billion, more =
than double what the president had been considering only a week ago. =
http://www.msnbc.com/news/854805.asp

Tomorrow at 7 p.m. ET, Pam Olson, assistant secretary of the treasury =
for tax policy, will join us in chat to discuss President Bush's new =
plan, and how it contrasts with the Democratic plan.  Submit questions =
in advance for that event through the chat page at http://Chat.MSNBC.com

Be sure to check out MSNBC.com politics reporter Tom Curry's dissection =
of the two parties' stimulus plans. http://www.msnbc.com/news/854511.asp

The MSNBC Question of the Day today asks, "Fixing the economy: Do you =
trust the Democrats more than Bush?" http://Question.MSNBC.com

WHAT CHATTERS ARE SAYING

newsjunkie says:  I trust neither, the more govt gets involved in the =
economy the more messed up it gets.

pmg says:  I don't trust Congress (they are the ones who pass the =
stuff).

donus says:  Not a chance.  The dems want to "fix" things by telling us =
what the country can do for us--the pubs are more interested in what we =
can do for the country---hmmm seems some famous dem once said that.

drain-o says:  Frankly, I'm tired of partisan politics, with all them =
crying, "my plan is better than your plan" why can't they get together =
and formulate a plan best for American people?

worldcitizen says:  I only trust myself. As far as fixing the country, =
neither party has validated a direction for serving the country, sooooo.

October says:  Apples and oranges  they're both fruit.

Add your opinions to the mix weekdays from 7:00 a.m. to 11 p.m. ET (10 =
