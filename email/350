HOW TO SPEAK DOG
By Stanley Coren

Now in paperback is a book that readers call "a canine
translator" =96 a volume that provides a wealth of insights on
how dogs communicate and how we often misread what they are saying.=20=20
Coren, known for his earlier book, The Intelligence of Dogs, here=20
explores among other topics the numbers of words that dogs can learn=20
and how to improve training through better knowledge of=20
canine "doggish" communication.
