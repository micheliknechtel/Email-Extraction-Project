Easy Recipes for one handed cook needed!
To make a long story short, I had a little rodeo with a horse I have been
training and broke my arm. This was two weeks ago. I have done a lot of
cooking and pulled out all my recipes that I knew I could handle. Well, now
we are sick of those. I live way out in the country and am not driving as of
yet, so fast food or take out is not an option. My husband works offshore
for an oil company and is gone until the 22nd. So, I need ideas for meals
that are fast and easy....

Site of the Week: Organized Home

I get mail from readers each week asking for specific types of websites.
(This is not a problem, so please feel free to ask.) The one I get the most
requests for are sites that help organize the home or just make things
easier in our lives. If you too are looking for ways to simplify your life,
well, have I got a site for you!

The first thing that grabbed me was their American Blessing mix with a gift
tag. You combine different foods along with a gift tag explaining what each
item represents. The gift tags are easy to print and very colorful. Of
course, this isn't going to simplify your life but it was a cute idea. They
have many different channels here and one is the Holiday Organizer. They
have more "friendship mixes"; gag gifts, cute homemade gifts as well as
corresponding gift tags to make. Make a gingerbread house and find frugal
holiday decorating tips as well.

"A Marine Mom Speaks" truly warmed my heart and further strengthened my
faith in those serving our country at this time. You can also sign up for
their free newsletter and just once or twice monthly get other inspirational
thoughts and some advice for getting organized. Many of us need to take baby
steps in our decluttering and this is a great way to begin.

They have many printable charts (if you can follow them) and really helpful
is they give you a week-by-week plan to get organized. You will find it
under "Holiday Grand Plan."How great! This has only covered a fraction of
what is wonderful about this site. I am telling you it is fantastic and
definitely worth a bookmark.

So, go take a peek ...

Guest Article - What My Mother Did Right
by Inez Haythorn, buffy@christianfamilytreasures.com

Parenting can be a hard job. With so many different theories in every book
or magazine you read, your mind is left spinning. Am I too strict or too
lenient? Do I pressure my kids too much, or am I not pushing them enough?
Are they in too many activities, or too few? Do they have too much structure
in their lives, or too much free time? The questions can go on and on, and
may leave you feeling paralyzed in your parenting skills.

My children are still teenagers, so I wouldn't dare try to advise someone
else in how to raise their children. I'm still working on my own! However, I
started thinking back on how I was raised. What did my mother do right? I
came up with some basic concepts that may be helpful to all of us.

CHRISTIAN TEACHING

First of all, she brought us up in the Lord. Starting as little girls, she
would have a short Bible story, song, and prayer before my sister and I went
to sleep. She saw to it that we attended church regularly, and it was
considered a priority. We were taught the discipline of going to church even
if we didn't feel like getting out of bed. She taught us right from wrong,
and we knew misbehavior would not be tolerated.

UNCONDITIONAL LOVE

Next, we knew Mother had unconditional love for us. I can remember as a
little girl in school picturing her loving smile when she saw me. We knew we
were treasured by her. My mother had kind words for us, and was always there
for us. She was faithful and dependable.

COMMUNICATION

Another important quality, especially as we started into the preteen and
teen years was communication. My mother was shock-proof. My sister and I
knew that we could talk to her about any subject at any time. She always
listened non-judgmentally and gave solid, wise answers. If we brought up a
questionable subject, she didn't panic or yell, even though she might have
felt that way inside. She would listen and calmly discuss the matter with
us.

My mom always explained "why". She never said, "Don't do this or that
because I said so." She would give us logical, intelligent reasons why we
shouldn't do something. Then, if other kids would make fun of me or question
why I didn't engage in a certain activity, I had a solid basis for an
answer. It kept me from being "caught up in the moment" many times. I still
laugh every time I think of one of my old college friends and a story that
she told us many years ago. Before a date, her mother would warn her not to
get too intimate "because it could lead to worse things". But she never knew
what the worse things were! Of course that was many years ago, when
teenagers were not as worldly-wise as they are now.

DEVELOPED TALENTS

Today, children are in so many activities. Each parent must decide what is
best for their own kids, and when they are in too much. My mom believed that
our talents should be developed. But we were only in one or two things. Our
family has always been musical, and my mother realized that my sister and I
both had musical talent. So she sacrificed to see to it that we had the best
piano teachers available. We had to practice, whether we wanted to or not.
We were not allowed to quit. She knew that we would regret giving it all up
for a childish whim. Even though I became an elementary teacher and not a
music major, the piano has greatly enriched my life. It has not only brought
pleasure to me, but I have been able to serve other people through being an
accompanist at church, choir, and grade school choruses.

RESPONSIBILITY

Responsibility was something else deemed important in our home. Mother was
not rigid in her expectations, but what we were supposed to do, we had to
do. For example, as mentioned before, we were responsible for going to
church and performing any duties we had there. School attendance, good
grades, and good behavior were also important. We were also responsible for
nightly chores, like washing and drying dishes. Every Saturday we had to
help clean the house before we could get together with friends or plan
dates.

GODLY EXAMPLE

Finally, my mother was a godly example. She practiced what she taught. She
was completely trustworthy and truthful. I still seek her wisdom almost
daily in raising my own sons. Her advice has been priceless. As I try to
apply these same principles in my own parenting, I pray that my boys will
become not only successful in life, but godly men of integrity.
