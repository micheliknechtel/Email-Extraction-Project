TiVo Tip: TiVo Tunes In
Until someone comes up with a "TiVo" for radio
(because wouldn't it be great if your radio
automatically tuned to any station playing your
favorite artist the minute said artist goes "live
on air"?), know that you've already got the next
best thing: Get in the groove by entering your
favorite musical artist as a WishList keyword search.
Use the PAUSE button for quotation marks to indicate
exact phrase. For example, enter [PAUSE button] FRANK
[Use FWD. button for space] SINATRA [PAUSE button]
and select "Auto-record episodes." (This trick often
unearths incredible musical guest performances from
the archives of "Saturday Night Live.") Or for general
music enthusiasts who like a little Salsa with all that
Jazz, try this tip: From TiVo Central, select "Pick
Programs to Record," then "Search Using WishList,"
then select "Category." Choose "Arts" as a category,
"Music" as a sub-category, then "View upcoming episodes."
See what strikes a chord and schedule recordings as the
music moves you! How's that for ending on a high note?



You Ask. we Answer.
Q. Nicole W. asks, "When the Home Media Option is
released, do I have to pay for the whole package to
use just the features I want? Also, will Home Media
Option be available on all TiVo DVRs, or just the Series2?"

A. Good questions, Nicole. In short, the answers are
yes and no respectively, but let's review each in more
detail.

By definition, Home Media Option is a bundled premium
package that includes four new features in networked
home entertainment: digital photos, digital music,
remote scheduling and multi-room viewing. So, yes,
Home Media Option is sold only in its entirety and
requires a one-time registration fee of $99 for the
first TiVo Series2 DVR.**** Additional TiVo Series2 DVRs
on the same account require a discounted one-time
registration fee of $49. Once a DVR is registered with
Home Media Option, that DVR is eligible to make use of
all four features. So to answer your question more
specifically, Home Media Option features will not be
sold a la carte. But they'll all be available. Try them
out, you may be surprised! 

Which leads us to your second question: No, not all
TiVo DVRs are enabled for Home Media Option. The four
features within Home Media Option will only be functional
on a TiVo Series2 DVR. Why? Because Home Media Option
requires the latest hardware design of the TiVo Series2,
including USB ports that enable easy, plug-and-play
networking opportunities in the home. 

Home Media Option is a fantastic foray into the world of
networked home entertainment and a natural enhancement
to all advanced digital recording services. But Home
Media Option remains exactly that: an option. If you
already have an always-on Internet connection at home
(DSL, cable modem, ISDN, etc.), and find yourself wishing
you could schedule a recording for your TiVo DVR while
still in the office, paying the one-time registration
fee of $99 might be well worth the money, even if that's
the only feature that interests you. Or music. Or photos.
Or multi-room viewing. There's a lot of good stuff there!

Oh, and one more thing: Once Home Media Option becomes
available, all subscribers with a TiVo Series2 will be
able to connect to the TiVo service using their always-on
Internet connection from home. And that's whether or not
you choose to purchase the premium package. (A standard
phone line is still required for your initial call during
Guided [or Repeat Guided] Setup.)

Learn more about all four features bundled together in the
TiVo Home Media Option premium package.

Did you know...?
...that "Trading Spaces," the remodeling show where neighbors
impose their decorating tastes on neighbors, is an American
twist on a British show called "Changing Rooms"? Find it on
BBC America. And here's a funny turn on that twist: last year,
a poll conducted for HGTV revealed that TV viewers ranked
"Trading Spaces" one of their favorite programs on the cable
channel. But guess what? You'll find the home improvement show
on TLC, not HGTV. Not the sharpest tools in the tool shed, eh?
Or maybe they just have TiVo! 



Home Media Option(TM): Remote Scheduling
Last newsletter, we highlighted Digital Music and Digital Photos,
two of the four new networked home entertainment features that
will be bundled together in Home Media Option, a premium package
for TiVo Series2 subscribers. Now, we'll spotlight the third
feature: Remote Scheduling from the web. Register your TiVo
Series2 DVR with Home Media Option and you'll be able to schedule
recordings from anywhere you have Internet access! How does it
work? You'll just go to tivo.com and schedule recordings online.
You'll be able to search for a show by time, title, keyword,
category, or actor/director and set up a single or Season Pass(TM)
recording, complete with all of the recording options. With remote
scheduling, it's never been easier to tell your TiVo DVR the shows
you don't want to miss, whether you're on the couch or in the
office. Next newsletter, we'll highlight the fourth component of
Home Media Option: Multi-room Viewing. Sign up to receive an
e-mail alert the minute Home Media Option becomes available!

I Heart (or is it Hart?) TV
How's this for Valentine's Day TV viewing: Stars like Jennifer
Lopez, George Clooney and Oprah Winfrey recounting their first
times...as subjects on "Entertainment Tonight." "The Stars'
First Time...On Entertainment Tonight With Mary Hart" will
air Feb. 14 at 8 p.m. Among the highlights of the one-hour
special, Hart told Variety, is Winfrey's original interview.
"She said, 'I know I made it now...I'm on 'Entertainment Tonight,'
and exuberantly sings the 'ET' theme song." Hart's husband,
Burt Sugarman, came up with the idea and will serve as an
executive producer.



WishList Searches Revisited
So subscriber Joan got her wish for the addition of "Figure
Skating" and Steve will surely jump when he sees "Cricket,"
but all of us will benefit from the new and improved system
now available on your TiVo DVR*** that categorizes television
programs into genres. These changes will deliver more refined
search results when you Search by Title or Create a WishList,
making it even easier for you to find the shows you don't want
to miss.

So, if you have existing WishList searches, please take a
moment to review the categories and subcategories selected.
In some instances, you may need to re-create them with the
new options. Here's a quick summary of the changes:
1) Fifty-nine new sports sub-categories were added. Woo-hoo!
The five most popular sports are now at the top, with the
remaining 88 alphabetized below. 2) Twenty-two brand-new
genres were added. Find them in "Interests," "Science and
Nature," and "News and Business." 3) The category "Arts &
Living" was renamed "Interests." 4) The category "Western"
was removed from the top level and the category "Arts" was
added. "Western" was placed under "Interests" as a sub-category
and eight arts-related genres, like "Music," were moved from
"Interests" to the new category "Arts." Whew! To create new
or edit existing WishList searches, simply: Go to TiVo Central
by pressing the TiVo button on your remote control, then
SELECT "Pick Programs to Record," then SELECT "Search Using
WishList."

                    Nicole W. asks, &quot;When the Home Media Option is released, 
                    do I have to pay for the whole package to use just the features 
                    I want? Also, will Home Media Option be available on all TiVo 
                    DVRs, or just the Series2?&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FF9900"><b><font size="3">A. 
                    </font></b></font>Good questions, Nicole. In short, the answers 
                    are yes and no respectively, but let's review each in more 
                    detail.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By definition, 
                    Home Media Option is a <i>bundled</i> premium package that 
                    includes four new features in networked home entertainment: 
                    digital photos, digital music, remote scheduling and multi-room 
                    viewing. So, yes, Home Media Option is sold only in its entirety 
                    and requires a one-time registration fee of $99 for the first 
                    TiVo Series2 DVR.<sup>&#134;</sup> Additional TiVo Series2 
                    DVRs on the same account require a discounted one-time registration 
                    fee of $49. Once a DVR is registered with Home Media Option, 
                    that DVR is eligible to make use of all four features. So 
                    to answer your question more specifically, Home Media Option 
                    features will not be sold a la carte. But they'll all be available. 
                    Try them out, you may be surprised! </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Which 
                    leads us to your second question: No, not all TiVo DVRs are 
                    enabled for Home Media Option. The four features within Home 
                    Media Option will only be functional on a TiVo Series2 DVR. 
                    Why? Because Home Media Option requires the latest hardware 
                    design of the TiVo Series2, including USB ports that enable 
                    easy, plug-and-play networking opportunities in the home. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Home Media 
                    Option is a fantastic foray into the world of networked home 
                    entertainment and a natural enhancement to all advanced digital 
                    recording services. But Home Media Option remains exactly 
                    that: an option. If you already have an always-on Internet 
                    connection at home (DSL, cable modem, ISDN, etc.), and find 
                    yourself wishing you could schedule a recording for your TiVo 
                    DVR while still in the office, paying the one-time registration 
                    fee of $99 might be well worth the money, even if that's the 
                    only feature that interests you. Or music. Or photos. Or multi-room 
                    viewing. There's a lot of good stuff there!</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oh, and 
                    one more thing: Once Home Media Option becomes available, 
                    all subscribers with a TiVo Series2 will be able to connect 
                    to the TiVo service using their always-on Internet connection 
                    from home. And that's whether or not you choose to purchase 
                    the premium package. (A standard phone line is still required 
                    for your initial call during Guided [or Repeat Guided] Setup.)</font></p>

                  that &quot;Trading Spaces,&quot; the remodeling show where neighbors 
                  impose their decorating tastes on neighbors, is an American 
                  twist on a British show called &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;? Find 
                  it on BBC America. And here's a funny turn on that twist: last 
                  year, a poll conducted for HGTV revealed that TV viewers ranked 
                  &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; one of their favorite programs on 
                  the cable channel. But guess what? You'll find the home improvement 
                  show on TLC, not HGTV. Not the sharpest tools in the tool shed, 
                  eh? Or maybe they just have TiVo! </font></td>

                  newsletter, we highlighted Digital Music and Digital Photos, 
                  two of the four new networked home entertainment features that 
                  will be bundled together in Home Media Option, a premium package 
                  for TiVo Series2 subscribers. Now, we'll spotlight the third 
                  feature: <b>Remote Scheduling</b> from the web. Register your 
                  TiVo Series2 DVR with Home Media Option and you'll be able to 
                  schedule recordings from anywhere you have Internet access! 
                  How does it work? You'll just go to tivo.com and schedule recordings 
                  online. You'll be able to search for a show by time, title, 
                  keyword, category, or actor/director and set up a single or 
                  Season Pass<sup>TM</sup> recording, complete with all of the 
                  recording options. With remote scheduling, it's never been easier 
                  to tell your TiVo DVR the shows you don't want to miss, whether 
                  you're on the couch or in the office. Next newsletter, we'll

                    to review the categories and subcategories selected. In some 
                    instances, you may need to re-create them with the new options. 
                    Here's a quick summary of the changes: 1) Fifty-nine new sports 
                    sub-categories were added. Woo-hoo! The five most popular 
                    sports are now at the top, with the remaining 88 alphabetized 
                    below. 2) Twenty-two brand-new genres were added. Find them 
                    in &quot;Interests,&quot; &quot;Science and Nature,&quot; 
                    and &quot;News and Business.&quot; 3) The category &quot;Arts 
                    &amp; Living&quot; was renamed &quot;Interests.&quot; 4) The 
                    category &quot;Western&quot; was removed from the top level 
                    and the category &quot;Arts&quot; was added. &quot;Western&quot; 
                    was placed under &quot;Interests&quot; as a sub-category and 
                    eight arts-related genres, like &quot;Music,&quot; were moved 
                    from &quot;Interests&quot; to the new category &quot;Arts.&quot; 
                    Whew! To create new or edit existing WishList searches, simply: 
                    Go to TiVo Central by pressing the TiVo button on your remote 
                    control, then SELECT &quot;Pick Programs to Record,&quot; 
                    then SELECT &quot;Search Using WishList.&quot;</font></p></td>
