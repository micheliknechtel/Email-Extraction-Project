-> NEW at WEBMONKEY <-

Boy let me tell you, this week is all about Macworld, what with it 
oh-so-conveniently just a hop, skip, and a bump away from Webmonkey HQ. 
Today Jobs whipped all the Mac mommies and daddies into a froth with the 
announcement of the new PowerBooks, with their crazy-huge, 17-inch screens; 
the "iLife" suite of bundled new versions of iMovie, iPhoto, iTune and 
iDVD; and "Safari," the new, Apple-branded browser that's supposed to make 
Webbing breezy for the Mac-endowed. Look for a power-review of the new 
browser here at Webmonkey later this week, but in the meantime, read all 
about the convention over at sister site Wired News:
