==> TOPIC: TM

From: Stacy Williams [stacy@prominentplacement.com]

I-Searchers,

I know we've been through this before, but I wanted to get the most
recent thinking (and rulings) on it.  I've got a client that's
insisting on using a competitor's brand name as a search term for
them to target.  Wait -- before you start throwing daggers, hear me
out.

They do have a legitimate reason to mention their competitor in the
site's content.  They've included in the copy information such as
"Our product is a low-cost alternative to Brand X."  They've put a
(R) registration mark next to Brand X.  As far as I know (not being
an attorney), this is perfectly legal and allowable.

We start getting into fuzzier territory, however, talking about
other places to use the search term, such as meta tags, alt tags,
etc.  (And yes, I'm perfectly aware that these "hidden" places don't
count for much, so there's no need to have that discussion again.)
I'm thinking that using the competitor's name in any hidden place,
or any place where we can't say at least a full sentence, like that
we're an alternative to Brand X for these reasons, that's a no-no.

I definitely do not want to get this client into any type of
trouble, either with their competitor in terms of legal issues, or
with the search engines in terms of spam issues.  Although the
safest way to go is to avoid using competitors' names
altogether...since this client is insisting, is there a way to use
them legitimately?

Thanks in advance,

Stacy Williams

Find out why Inktomi Paid Inclusion should be the first step in all
Search Engine Marketing Campaigns:

Professional search engine marketers know that every successful
search engine marketing campaign starts with Inktomi Paid Inclusion.
It's timely, it ensures deep, up-to-date content is included in the
Inktomi index, and very quickly the marketer has some real data to
assess their website's performance. If changes are made, the impact
can be weighed within weeks rather than months.  Read the full story
at Marketleap. http://altfarm.mediaplex.com/ad/ck/1497-10592-3840-1

Dear Fellow I-Searchers,

I have been trying to get some sites registered in ODP and About.com
for months now, with no success.  Is anyone else having trouble
getting registered in these directories? I am submitting large
commercial sites that are completely relevant to the categories I am
requesting.  If anyone has any tips on how to reach the editors, or
any other way to get registered in these directories, please let me
know.

Thanks!

From: Roy Philbrow [framtak@post.olivant.fo]

Hello all

Has anyone any thoughts or ideas about the two new tools that Google
is working on at labs.google.com ?

Should we be doing anything to improve our showing in Google Viewer
and WebQuotes? It looks like Google Viewer doesn't use css files?
What method does WebQuotes use to get it's quotes - it seems a bit
haphazard?

On a different subject, does anyone have any advice about award
sites? Is it likely to increase traffic if you win a few awards?

Greetings from the Faroe Islands

From: Prescott Shibles [Searchenghelp@primediabusiness.com]

>> If you're going to subscribe to both you might as well do it at
Position Tech as it's much easier to manage. If the question is
whether FAST's paid inclusion is worth it. <<

I definitely agree with you that Position Tech is a great one-stop
shop forPFI.  Position Pro is also a great piece of software.  I
also question FAST's value at this time, and I'm also curious to hear
not just about FAST's PFI, but Jeeves, AV and other programs, also.
I have strong editorial inclusion in both FAST and Jeeves/TEOMA, and
referrers from them are weak.I've heard from some in Europe that
FAST is worth-while and that Jeeves has a unique audience, but I
still have a hard time spending the time and effort monitoring
something that isn't generating significant volume.

Thanks, Detlev.

==> FAST PFI

From: Jill Whalen [jill@highrankings.com]

Actually, Lycos InSite now has the same PositionTech interface and
ease of use.  You can submit to FAST and Inktomi at the same time,
just as with PT. I believe you even save a buck if you do it from
Lycos!

Whether it's worth paying is another story.  Inktomi and FAST have
been pretty good at finding and indexing pages for free these days,
so keep that in mind.

Best,

Jill

[ Moderator Comment ]:
True.  The reason the services exist, however, are for your
important pages that do not seem to get in (or on time.)  Also,
Lycos InSite similarities to PT are due to PT powering a good
portion of Lycos's InSite service offering:
http://www.terralycos.com/press/pr_11_11e_02.html I can confidently
suggest that saving a buck is likely due to currency and amount
translation across the two systems.  No service provider (even
Lycos) will offer a discount on these services.  Details like that
typically are locked up in the contract so both parties win over
time, and no one goes without.  -d

==> TOPIC: CCTLD

From: Reid Carr [rcarr@reddoor.biz]

Regarding the post about International SEO, it has been our
experience that if you acquire a CCTLD that relates to the
appropriate country search engine, regardless of similar content to
another site, it will not be recognized as "the same" as the
US-based or other international Web site. The rankings, however, are
up to you and how you promote it within that country's realm of the
Internet.

Hope that helps.

==>TOPIC:  CSS

From: Terry Van Horne [terryvh@online-toronto.net]

Hi All!

>> can anyone confirm that search engine spiders will recognise CSS
formatting and treat it as if it were traditional HTML? <<

using a class in css isn't going to have the same result as
using<h1> because it isn't a **known value**. A search engine that
uses H1 in its algo is looking for an <H1>  container. CSS
formatting in your example is not a known value. However you can do
it like this and get the advantages of CSS.

<.XTYLE TYPE="text/css">
H1{FONT-SIZE: 100%;COLOR: red;text-align: center}
<./XTYLE>

A browser that supports Css will display <H1> tags using the
information in the CSS.

==> CSS

From: Scott Kinney [sakinney@ix.netcom.com]

I can't claim to know how the search engines read CSS-modified text, but it seems to me that there's a simple solution to the question.

Just apply the style attributes to the H1, H2, etc tags in the style sheet. (as opposed to creating an entity called 'heading'). That way you're covered if the search engines actually *do* pay attention to the H1 tags, and you get to control the appearance the way you want.

==> TOPIC: YAHOO! UK

From: Gerald Steffens [gerald.steffens@owl-online.de]

Jennifer,

>> We would like to submit this UK site to the UK versions of the
USA search engines and directories, but we are concerned that it
will not be accepted <<

Yahoo! UK will definitely be a problem, they rejected a UK site of a
customer whose entrance-level pages were all different from US
version, prices were in pound and so on.Here is the answer from
yahoo! uk after i tried to convince them to change their mind:

-------------- answer yahoo ---------------------------

Thank you for your mail. We have reviewed the site once more but the
content of http://uk-site.and http://us-site Xppears to be identical
despite the difference in layout. As the content is not unique our
decision to not add http://uk-site to the directory remains
unchanged. ... and so on ...

-------------------------------------------------------

but you may try it, perhaps you have more luck and get another
editor withis more gracious.

>> We plan in the future to create a German site with the same
content in German. Would this be seen as a significantly different
site so as not to be thrown out of a search engine or directory
because the USA site is already listed? <<

Searchengines will take the German site without problems. And the
same forthe catalogs. In the above case it was no problem to get the
site intoYahoo! DE. And that's very reasonable, otherwise german
customers would not be able to find/use the site/content.
