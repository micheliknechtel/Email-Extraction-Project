==> TOPIC: BACK IN THE SADDLE

Greetings:

Did ya miss me over the Christmas, er, holiday (politically correct)
break?  I know I missed you.  And it's fairly obvious that no amount
of stale fruitcakes could keep the world's branding issues from
burning into I-Branders' minds.  Personally, I spent the time off
moving my FrankelBiz Branded Community to its new i-legions
platform. It's still in its infancy, with more services being
finalized over this month, but you can feast your baby blues on it
at http://www.Frankelbiz.com if you like.

In the meantime, there are plenty of soul-searching issues to tickle
your fancy this week, not the least of which is a new I-Brander's
sincere request for help in telling the real branding stuff from the
fakes.

I also am pleased to report that every indication I see points to an
increase in branding activity, both as a discipline and a required
marketing tool.  I believe that 2003 is the year that will see
branding gain its own respectability, formally differentiated from
advertising, marketing and other related fields.

Which is good, considering this is how I make my living....

Lots of stuff to get to.  Let's hear your responses next week!

Your Branding Buddy,

===>TOPIC: FEAR OF BRANDING

From: Laurie Freisinger  <sliceoflifecafe@shaw.ca>

Hi Rob,

I have been reading your branding website and find it quite
fascinating.  I have just recently solicited and received a proposal
from a branding company in my area.  I have a small pizza by the
slice cafe in a small town on Vancouver Island in British Columbia,
Canada.  We bought this 4 year old cafe Sept. 2001 doubled the
revenue the first year and now feel that we need to do more to
increase the volume of customer through our door but don't know how.
I realize that it will cost us money to create the perfect brand but
I am fearful of putting our hard earned money into something that
isn't going to do the trick.  How do I know if this company knows
what they are doing?  It's easy enough for one to say they know what
they are doing but what I have found so often these days is a lot of
talk and not so much action.  A lot of hot air to be exact.  What
can I do, where should I go , where do I start for the right
branding help.

Laurie, you have every right to be suspicious and fearful.  I've
seen a ton of "branding services" that are actually little more than
warmed-over designers or out of work ad people.  Harsh, but true.
The best test of a branding expert's mettle is to ask for their
deliverables:  if it's little more than a name and a logo, turn and
run.  Fast.  BTW, this is exactly the kind of question I answer in
depth at http://www.FrankelTips.com. I-Branders, what advice would
you give Laurie? -- Rob

===>TOPIC: ROB, YOU'VE BEEN BANISHED!

From:  Darhl Stultz <Darhl_C_Stultz@raytheon.com>

Followed a link to Lake Superior State University's annual Banished
Word list and horrors for you... "branding" is among the words in
their 2003 list. Here's their blurb on it...

"BRANDING -- This word, once properly associated with marking
livestock to prove ownership, has been co-opted by the MBA crowd and
now seems to refer to any activity that supports a company's desire
to clearly define its products and/or services. Can't we just say
'Promotions and PR?" Nancy Hicks, Fairfax, Virginia.

You've been known to take the bull by the horns, so what's going to
be your response?

(Which reminds us of Bess Truman's response to a friend who remarked
about Harry's frequent use of the word "manure".  Said Bess, "Dear,
you don't know how long it took me to get him to use that word.")

My response?  Who cares about my response?  I want to know what
I-Branders' responses are going to be.  I always respond the same
way:  a general rolling of the eyes along with a general castigation
of the stupidity of modern marketing sages as we know them.  Of
course, I'm just guessing here.....--Rob

===>TOPIC: GAP CRAP

From: "Jeff Schlesinger" <jdschlesinger@tracertags.com>

Rob,

I don't think Gap has ever created a brand. All the pieces were
there to implement, but it seems like they lost site of their brand
about the same time Calvin Klein was commenting that "nothing gets
between me and my Calvin Klein jeans".  Their current ad campaign is
bad enough. Exactly what do all those beautiful young people singing
a old hit tune have to do with selling clothing apparel anyway?

The only Gap branding that I can think of is the blue and white logo
on their store front, bags and the Gap label above the pocket on the
butt of their jeans. We used to go to Gap for the quality denim
jeans. Not a verbal or written mention of that brand attribute ever
that I can remember. I really don't recall Gap branding there
clothing ever. So exactly what are they reviving? Their logo?

I agree and happen to think that GAP brings retail brand mediocrity
to a new low.  Of course, not everyone learns from K-Mart's
stumbling.....-- Rob

===>TOPIC: HTML FORMATTING

From: "John McCabe" <jmccabe@web-guides.com>

Maybe it's me, and I don't really think so...

Usually, the html version of the digest is very easy to read. For
some reason, the formatting in the 12/18 issue made it almost
unreadable. Black text overlapped dark blue graphic elements, things
were off-kilter, generally a mess.

Would it be possible to reformat and resend?

Thanks...

===>TOPIC: SELF BRANDING

From: Lynn <lynn@ecgincc.com>

Mitch, I can't answer your question on self branding, but I did
notice something interesting about marketers. I attended a holiday
networking party sponsored by a state-level association. With the
exception of one techie, everyone else I met was a marketing person.
I exchanged cards with several, at my instigation. I am still
wondering why none of the marketing people did.

I noticed on the cards I collected, the people working for a major
corp had cards with their own domain names and email addresses using
their domain names. Others did not have a domain name for their
business. Still others had a domain name for a web site, but used
their ISP domain name for email.

The Association website has a logo of the web development company
that created the site. I do not use IE. I could not see much of the
site.

The networking party was Thursday evening. As I have been busy, I
didn't have time to send email to those I had an email address. I
did this morning.

Not one of the 'marketing' people sent me an email. None have
replied to my email (several hours later). I received one reply -
from the techie.

My conclusion - we could teach the experts a lot about marketing and
branding (oh yes, there were branding people there too - included in
the cards I received)

Draw your own conclusions as to their expertise.

Oh Rob, I gave one person your addy, and followed up with it in
email. A branding 'expert' that has no clue about online branding.

Are surprised?  I think not.  Lynn's experience only goes to show
what I've said all along:  branding is the most misunderstood
discipline in all of marketing.  Oh, also that all referrals are
welcome. -- Rob

===>TOPIC: SELF BRANDING

From: "Mitch Joel" <mitch@twistimage.com>

Thanks for some of the insight. One of the main reasons I wrote the
initial email was to spark a conversation. We're presently re-doing
a lot of the issues brought up in Arlene's comments. Our company has
a desperate need to balance good, strong and valid content with
killer design.

The idea of self-branding is difficult for us to let go of because
a) we are very creative and are looking forward to taking many
people's advice as to the new "play" of the site and b) all too
often you'll see sites that dazzle the eyes with little content
(like the current Twist Image website) or sites that are all content
are fairly poorly designed. I think the challenge we all face is to
show people - in a very web-friendly way - how the process of the
business works and what it "smells" like without actually walking
into our studio space.

I'm still challenged by the concept of letting another marketing
company walk through our doors when, by simply looking at their
sites and services, they do not have the necessary balance of
design, content and technology. It's a big plate of food to eat and
I'm not entirely confident that we, as marketers, truly show our
clients what they can do. Specifically, by showing the client via
what we've done for ourselves.

Another opportunity for thoughts and comments... ;)

===>TOPIC: AWARENESS VS. SALES

From: "Eddy Budianto" <herr@centrin.net.id>

Dear I-Branders,

Recently I just read Sergio Book's : The End of Advertising as we
know it.

At that book, He mentioned that brand awareness is useless if it not
increase the sales. Sure it is. the point is when you advertise,
build the brand and etc, you have to make sure that you explain to
the customer why they should buy your brand. It means that all
advertisement, promotion etc which could add brand awareness is
totally useless if it not increase the sales.

The topic are : Is it possible we could sell the product without
brand awareness? The point is true that many people know about HONDA
but how many people will buy HONDA compare to its competitor. If
product A's brand awareness is higher than product B's brand, it
doesn't mean its sales higher too.. so.. what is the ideal way in
this case? according to Sergio, it is only one... that is you have
to tell customer why they must buy your brand. it sure is.. but how?

Rgrds,
Eddy

===>TOPIC: BRAND RESPONSIBILITY

From: Arlene Teck <rlene@rcn.com>

As it happens, I am with Allen on the McDonald's thing. Even though
I personally prefer Wendy's, many, many people eat McDonald's
hamburgers and do not get ill.

Rather, it is the combination of things we eat over our lifetimes
that may make us ill, and no one is to "blame" for that, except
ourselves. Carried to the logical conclusion, no restaurant could
afford to be in business unless it carried its own form of
malpractice insurance and required all patrons to sign waivers.
Ridiculous!

That fat kid and his lawyer are pulling a scam -- and the more
people who know it, the better!

As it happens, I get migraine headaches from eating the chocolate
bits in chocolate chip cookies. A sad state of affairs for me -- but
I am not suing Nestlé's!

Of course, social responsibility is more of a good thing than not,
but in essence, I believe, it begins at home -- with the choices we
make about our own lives.
