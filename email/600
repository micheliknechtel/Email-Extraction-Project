</a> Hi Friends!


OK, where the HELL has Dan been for the past week???

A number of things have been going on... First, there was the stint in 
jail.... Yeah, they caught me... Seems that making your own booze in your 
sink is OK, but opening up a store and selling it outta Mason jars isn't....

Nah, but seriously, Friends, I've been outta town for a couple of weeks, 
and although everything is <chuckle - snort> automated with TheBarrel, 
sometimes the unforeseen is seen... I toasted the power supply on the 
server that runs the mailing lists.... And I was outta town... I got a new 
power supply this weekend, and all is again right with the world....

Oh yeah, and the site is updated! All you Babes, take a gander at the 
Hunks, and all you Hunks, feel free to drool over the Babe!




Let's Laugh!

Leola Starling of Ribrock, Tenn., had a serious telephone problem. But 
unlike most people she did something about it.
The brand-new $10 million Ribrock Plaza Motel opened nearby and had 
acquired almost the same telephone number as Leola.

 From the moment the motel opened, Leola was besieged by calls not for her. 
Since she had the same phone number for years, she felt that she had a case 
to persuade the motel management to change its number.

Naturally, the management refused claiming that it could not change its 
stationery.

The phone company was not helpful, either. A number was a number, and just 
because a customer was getting someone else's calls 24 hours a day didn't 
make it responsible. After her pleas fell on deaf ears, Leola decided to 
take matters into her own hands.

At 9 o'clock the phone rang. Someone from Memphis was calling the motel and 
asked for a room for the following Tuesday. Leoloa said, "No problem. How 
many nights?"

A few hours later Dallas checked in. A secretary wanted a suite with two 
bedrooms for a week. Emboldened, Leola said the Presidential Suite on the 
10th floor was available for $600 a night. The secretary said that she 
would take it and asked if the hotel wanted a deposit. "No, that won't be 
necessary," Leola said. "We trust you."

The next day was a busy one for Leola. In the morning, she booked an 
electric appliance manufacturers' convention for Memorial Day weekend, a 
college prom and a reunion of the 82nd Airborne veterans from World War II.

She turned on her answering machine during lunchtime so that she could 
watch the O.J. Simpson trial, but her biggest challenge came in the 
afternoon when a mother called to book the ballroom for her daughter's 
wedding in June.

Leola assured the woman that it would be no problem and asked if she would 
be providing the flowers or did she want the hotel to take care of it. The 
mother said that she would prefer the hotel to handle the floral 
arrangements. Then the question of valet parking came up.

Once again Leola was helpful. "There's no charge for valet parking, but we 
always recomend that the client tips the drivers."

Within a few months, the Ribrock Plaza Motel was a disaster area. People 
kept showing up for weddings, bar mitzvahs, and Sweet Sixteen parties and 
were all told there were no such events.

Leola had her final revenge when she read in the local paper that the motel 
might go bankrupt. Her phone rang, and an executive from Marriott said, 
"We're prepared to offer you $200,000 for the motel."

Leola replied. "We'll take it, but only if you change the telephone number."

Jane was a first time contestant on the $65,000
quiz show.

Lady luck had smiled in her favour, as Jane had
a gained substantial lead over her opponents.

She even managed to win the game but,
unfortunately, time had run out before the show's
host could ask her the big question.

Jane agreed to return the following day.

Jane was nervous as her husband drove them home.

"I've just gotta win tomorrow.
I wish I knew what the answers are!
You know I'm not going to sleep at all tonight.
I will probably look like garbage tomorrow."

"Relax honey," her husband, Roger, reassured her,

"It will all be OK."

Ten minutes after they arrived home, Roger
grabbed the car keys and started heading out the
door.

"Where are you going?" Jane asked.

"I have a little errand to run.
I should be back soon."

After an agonizing 3-hour absence,
Roger returned, sporting a very wide and wicked
grin.

"Honey, I managed to get tomorrow's question
and answer!"

"What is it?" she cried excitedly.

"OK. The question is
'What are the three main parts of the male
anatomy?'

And the answer is
'The head, the heart, and the penis.' "

The couple went to sleep with Jane, now feeling
at ease, plummeting into a deep slumber.

At 3:30 a.m., however, Jane was shaken awake by
Roger, who was asking her the quiz show question.

"The head, the heart, and the penis,"
Jane replied groggily before returning to sleep. And

Roger asked her again in the morning, this time
as Jane was brushing her teeth.

Once again, Jane replied correctly.

So it was that Jane was once again on the set of
the quiz show.

Even though she knew the question and answer,
she could feel butterflies.

The cameras began running and the host, after
reminding the audience of the previous days'
events, faced Jane and asked the big question.

"Jane, for $65,000, what are the main parts of
the male anatomy?
You have 10 seconds."

"Hmm, um, the head?" she said nervously.

"Very good. Six seconds."

"Eh, uh, the heart?"

"Very good! Four seconds."

"I, uhh, ooooooohh, darn!
My husband drilled it into me last night and I
had it on the tip of my tongue this morning..."

"That's close enough!" said the game show host,
"CONGRATULATIONS!!

........... You win the $65,000!!"

Q: Why do men pass gas more than women do?
A: Because women won't shut up long enough to build up pressure.


This is a true story... there's a female news anchor
who, the day after it was supposed to have snowed and
didn't, turned to the weatherman and said, "So Bob,
where's that 6 inches you promised me last night?"
Not only did he have to leave the set, but half the
crew did too they were laughing so hard!


Bigamy is having one wife too many.
Some say monogamy is the same.

The Top 15 Biblical Ways to Acquire a Wife

1. Find an attractive prisoner of war, bring her home, shave her
head, trim her nails, and give her new clothes. Then she's yours.
(Deuteronomy 21:11-13)

2. Find a prostitute and marry her. (Hosea 1:1-3)

3. Find a man with seven daughters, and impress him by watering
his flock. -Moses (Exodus 2:16-21)

4. Purchase a piece of property, and get a woman as part of the
deal. -Boaz (Ruth 4:5-10)

5. Go to a party and hide. When the women come out to dance,
grab one and carry her off to be your wife. -Benjaminites
(Judges 21:19-25)

6. Have God create a wife for you while you sleep. Note:
This will cost you. -Adam (Genesis 2:19-24)

7. Agree to work seven years in exchange for a woman's hand in
marriage. Get tricked into marrying the wrong woman. Then work
another seven years for the woman you wanted to marry in the first
place. That's right. Fourteen years of hard labor for a wife.
-Jacob (Genesis 29:15-30)

8. Cut 200 foreskins off of your future father-in-law's enemies
and get his daughter for a wife. -David (I Samuel 18:27)

9. Even if no one is out there, just wander around a bit and
you'll definitely find someone. (It's all relative, of course.)
-Cain (Genesis 4:16-17)

10. Become the emperor of a huge nation and hold a beauty contest.
-Xerxes or Ahasuerus (Esther 2:3-4)

11. When you see someone you like, go home and tell your parents,
"I have seen a ... woman; now get her for me." If your parents
question your decision, simply say, "Get her for me. She's the one
for me." -Samson (Judges 14:1-3)

12. Kill any husband and take HIS wife (Prepare to lose four sons,
though). -David (2 Samuel 11)

13. Wait for your brother to die. Take his widow. (It's not just
a good idea; it's the law.) -Onan and Boaz (Deuteronomy or Leviticus,
example in Ruth)

14. Don't be so picky. Make up for quality with quantity.
-Solomon (1 Kings 11:1-3)

15. A wife? ... NOT! -Paul (1 Corinthians 7:32-35)
