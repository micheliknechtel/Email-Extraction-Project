I expected to be filing this column from Las Vegas, where
CES--the world's largest consumer electronics show--is
wrapping up. Instead I write this from the comforts of my
home office. It seems I skip more than half the conferences
I sign up for because there's just too much to do on the
home front. I might be better about this if I actually liked
schmoozing with PR reps and overloading my circuits with
products that have a 10 percent chance of landing in our
lab. But the truth is, I dread the whole thing. For all
those reps who actually looked forward to seeing my shiny
head, I'll see you in Los Angeles in May for E3, where we
will be the ones to roll out an exciting new product.
As with Comdex, I'm glad I stayed home for more reasons than
my disdain for street porn. By all the accounts I read, CES
was a bit of a dud. No earth-shattering new products were
released. Most of the interesting releases were somewhat
expected. Bill Gates' most interesting item was a watch that
has nothing on the latest GPS wrist clock from Suunto. So if
I had gone to CES, I would have wished I was in San
Francisco for MacWorld.

Contrary to all the advance notice, Apple released some very
cool products there and, in two cases at least, it shocked
the computing world. Steve Jobs trumped Bill Gates by a
long shot.

As for merely interesting products, Apple's two new G4
PowerBooks will lead the industry for at least another year.
Since I can't say anything more interesting than David Pogue
has said with his column in the New York Times Friday, I
refer you to that. Also included in this category are
upgrades of all of Apple's digital hub applications, iPhoto,
iDVD, et al. While Microsoft was busy releasing first
versions of some of these products (disdaining an industry
standard--MPEG-4--in the process), Apple's upgrades show
that it is at least a generation ahead of all comers in
these popular applications. As my predictions last week will
attest, these applications show that Apple has its priorities
straight by focusing on the convergence of computing and
entertainment appliances.

As for the shocking new releases, Apple has outdone itself
with the releases of Safari--the fastest and best browser on
the market in our tests--and Keynote--a presentation program
that in its first release is already better than PowerPoint
in some ways. It is not shocking that Apple was capable of
these feats. It is often ahead of the game on the software
it releases. The shocking thing is that Apple has released
applications that compete against parts of Microsoft's
Office hegemony. As Robert Cringely has shown in his column
Friday, this is a first for Apple, which has lived under the
unpleasant thumb of its neighbor to the far north since
before PCs were business machines. While Cringely is right
on the money here, he has glossed over a key aspect of the
Apple/Microsoft relationship that needs to be said. Back in
1998, soon after Steve Jobs returned to Apple's helm, he
made what pundits called an unholy alliance with Microsoft.
Faced with a cash crunch and the threat of Microsoft dumping
Office and Internet Explorer (IE) for the Mac (a threat
Microsoft makes often, as Cringely points out), Jobs was
forced to sell Microsoft a stake in Apple. Some of the
details of this agreement are still shrouded in mystery; but
it is widely rumored that Jobs also promised not to compete
seriously with Microsoft on key applications. These rumors
have a ring of truth to them: many Apple loyalists soon
after noted that AppleWorks was crippled, relative to its
predecessors and that new Macs favored Office in all ways.
One thing was clear: new Macs had a new default
browser--IE--contrary to its long-standing relationship with
Netscape.

I, for one, have always disdained IE on the Mac. It is
dreadfully slow and it has a tendency to render graphics in
the wrong place. It is very good at some things, though,
such as making sure that pop-up ads, rogue cookies, and
spyware load flawlessly. I avoid it as much as I can, except
to check our site with it and issue bug reports to our
Webmaster James Kim. So for me, the new Safari browser is a
boon. In our tests, it loads sites four times faster than
IE. Our own site loads on Safari in a microsecond, whereas
it sometimes takes more than a 30 seconds on IE, as users
frequently point out. And Safari rejects pop-ups and
pop-unders by default. It has other user interface elegance
that Elizabeth Millard will share with you in detail in a
March review.

More important than Safari's superior performance and
elegant UI, though, is the mere fact that Jobs is turning
his back on the 1998 agreement by abandoning IE and
developing applications that directly compete with Office.
Perhaps some of the shadow clauses in the agreement had
time limits or something. Whatever the reason, it bodes
well for Mac users and for Apple. If the new Keynote
application (which works with all PowerPoint presentations)
is any indication of Apple's future direction, expect a full
Apple Office suite that works faster, better, cheaper, and
more elegantly than Office X, and imports and exports to
Office for colleagues who are Windows users. And if
FileMaker is a guide, I wouldn't be surprised if a later
version of the new suite also works on Windows machines for
a fraction of the cost of Office. That would really shock
the world.
