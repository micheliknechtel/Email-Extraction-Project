Hello Bass Matter Subscribers!

WOW, I'm glad to see you really do read my newsletter. I
had so many responses on my Saturday column regarding
the cloned baby. The majority of the emails received are
against cloning of humans and animals. Many have stated
there are more important things to concentrate on: cures
cancer, the common cold, heart disease, ms, etc.  

Another reader points out.. we haven't even seen any
pictures of the cloned baby, have we?  HMMM... Why not?

Ok, let's move on to the newsletter.

	Deadly Winter Time Bass Lures 

The cold winter waters slows down the bass feeding activities. 
Since the body of the fish takes on the water temperatures, 
these fish become very sluggish during winter. Casting lures 
to the banks will not usually find many active fish. But learn 
to read a high quality Lowrance depth finder and take out some 
slow moving baits and the fish can still be caught. Bass will 
retire to deep water and regardless of the extremes in 
temperatures, bass still have to feed. Lures need to be placed 
as close to the fish as possible. This is the time of year when 
fishing vertically will work. 


Several lures are deadly for winter time action. Many anglers 
use spoons all winter. The spoons will work, but there are 
other lures that will work just as well. 


Buck tail jigs look like shad to a bass. Using several sizes 
and colors, dropping these lures straight down to the bass will 
get a strike. Hop them off the bottom and adding small trailers 
will work. 


Worms are the best lures for bass all year. Take a small finesse 
worm and rig it up on a Texas rig. The secret for winter time 
worm jigging is to peg the sinker. Drop the bait right to the 
bottom around points and creek bends. 


Jigs are used for cold water bass fishing. There is no reason 
not to drop this bait vertically and jig it just like the spoon. 
Use a variety of sizes and colors and add some extra crawfish 
scent on these baits.  Jigging spoons will work all year. But 
they are especially deadly in the winter. Spoons dropped to the 
bottom appear to a bass like a dying bait fish. Using different 
of colors and sizes of spoons will work. Fish the spoons into 
and under schools of bass and bait fish. 


Always place the nose of the boat into any wind and make sure 
the baits are fish straight down under the boat. Drifting over 
deep points and flats slowly will put fish in the boat. 


Vertical fishing is an art. It takes practice and patience. 
Adding this technique to winter time fishing will add hours
of great fishing.

                  FISHING JOKES CORNER
------------------------------------------------------------

Never Try to Outsmart a Woman:

A man calls home to his wife and says, "Honey I have been 
asked to go fishing at a big lake up in Canada with my boss
and several of his friends. We'll be gone for a week. This is 
a good opportunity for me to get that promotion I've been 
wanting so would you please pack me enough clothes for a week 
and set out my rod and tackle box. We're leaving from the office
and I will swing by the house to pick my things up. Oh! Please 
pack my new blue silk pajamas."

The wife thinks this sounds a little fishy but being a good
wife she does exactly what her husband asked.

The following weekend he comes home a little tired but otherwise
looking good. The wife welcomes him home and asks if he caught
many fish. He says, "Yes! Lot's of Walleye, some Bluegill, and 
a few Pike. But why didn't you pack my new blue silk pajamas 
like I asked you to do?"

The wife replies "I did, they were in your tackle box."
