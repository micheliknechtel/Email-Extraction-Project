Downloading Your Software 
******************************************************
We know that downloading software for the first time can be tricky, so h=
ere are a few simple steps to help walk you through your first downloadi=
ng experience. 

Step One: When you complete your purchase, you'll be directed to an orde=
r confirmation page that includes a download button. Click it to begin d=
ownloading your software! Download Instructions: http://handango.custhel=
p.com/cgi-bin/handango.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=3D776

Step Two: Some software requires you to download a zip file to your desk=
top before installation onto your device. In this case, download the fil=
e and follow the Installation Instructions: http://handango.custhelp.com=
/cgi-bin/handango.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=3D777 

Step Three: Many software applications require you to enter a registrati=
on key before unlocking for unlimited use. You'll be prompted for this k=
ey the first time you open the app on your device. Upon completing the p=
urchase, you'll receive your registration key in one of two ways dependi=
ng on the software developer:

1.Registration key will appear on the order confirmation page as well as=
 in your order confirmation email. 
2.No registration key required! As soon as you download and install your=
 software, it's ready to use.

AQ knowledge base and contact a Customer Care rep via email or phone.
