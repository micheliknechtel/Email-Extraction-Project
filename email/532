free and low-cost search engine optimization resources for
your reference. We were delighted to discover several new
to this publication on the list, including a link to a
popularity analysis tool (aptly named "Link Popularity
Analysis") which includes a Google search engine ranking
algorithm analysis. We were also intrigued by the Link
Reputation Analyzer from OptiLink, which rates the

Kazaa
http://www.kazaa.com/us/index.php
     Welcome to the post-Napster world. Wildly popular
file-sharing site Kazaa is a top 10 Internet destination
(note - it sometimes shows up under the "official" company
name of Sharman Networks). At the site, users download an
application called the Kazaa Media Desktop, which enables
them to share audio, video or other content files directly
using peer-to-peer (P2P) technology.
     While the entertainment industry continues to bemoan
this practice, early adopters like Microsoft are working
with P2P content packagers such as Altnet to distribute
copy-protected viral marketing content via the Kazaa
network. To combat the naysayers, Kazaa is promoting
the concept of an Intellectual Property User Fee (IPUF),
suggesting that a small fee could be added to ISP
subscriptions to pay artists and content companies for
use of their content.

Repeat Yourself. Repeat Yourself.

Repetition helps reinforce key benefits in the mind of the
prospect. Too many writers think it insulting to repeat key
benefits. You don't have to hammer the same point home in
lockstep sequence. That can be perceived as talking down to
readers, which will have them leaving your copy or Web page
quickly.

Repeating key benefits throughout your copy or website not
only underscores benefits, it also makes sure that readers
see them no matter where they enter your package, be it a
brochure or website. You don't know where readers/surfers
come into you. In a brochure, it could easily be on the
fifth or eighth panel. The same is true for a website, where
a search engine is likely to show a page on your site that's
six layers down instead of the top level home page. This
akes sense, since there's probably more content on that
sixth level page than on your home page.

Repeating yourself is also a good idea when you ask surfers
or readers to click on a link. You want to reinforce that
they've clicked over to the right place. So in your
newsletter you may say "Click Here to Get Your Free Download
on Email Marketing Tips." On that landing page, it helps to
say "Welcome! Here Are Your Free Email Marketing Tips - Click
Here to Download."

So, remember, repeat yourself.

PUBLISHER'S NOTE
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Lessons Learned from a Decade in Online Marketing

This year marks my tenth year of being in business online.
My first endeavor was The Online Ad Agency. There wasn't much
on the Net back then, except for things like the Jet
Propulsion Lab and other geeky sites.

My shop was the first marketing entity of its kind. It drew
lots of publicity in Business Week, The New York Times, on
CNN, CNBC, CBS and so forth. It was a feeding frenzy. I was
fielding 30 to 40 phone calls a day. I named it The Online
Ad Agency because I came from Madision Avenue, where I was
a copywriter for firms like IBM, AT&T and other blue
chippers.

It took me one year to realize that my firm shouldn't be an
ad agency. Why? Because the nature of that business is too
labor intensive and wouldn't draw enough billings for the
commission model to pay me and my people properly. Some
agencies are just now understanding this truth. Some will
never get it.

So in 1994, I revamped my business model so that my company
functions like a consultancy, where we get paid for
transferring knowledge. My revamped company was renamed Chase
Online Marketing Strategies Inc., which is the parent
company of this newsletter. One proven revenue stream of
this business is my speaking engagements (which I refer
to as "mass consulting"), where I demonstrate to
organizations how to get their money's worth from
the Internet.

One innovation that I brought to mass consulting is the
75-minute "Discovery Session". Held weeks in advance, the
client team and I brainstorm and nail down exactly what they
want their attendees to walk away with. (For more on this,
visit http://larrychase.com/seminars.html.)

After ten years, I notice there is still a chasm between ad
agencies and consultancies in this medium. Ad agencies
typically aren't good at techno-weenie projects where piles
of code are needed. Consultancies are better at that, but
not so hot when it comes to conjuring creative campaigns
and executing them. That's where guys like me come in to
bridge that gap.

Over the years I've learned many lessons that I carry forward
into my second decade online.

I learned that what worked last year may or may not work this
year or next. Some things that worked five years ago, then
stopped working, are now just starting to work again. Why?
Because five years ago it was too early for some ideas and
now this medium has matured enough to embrace what was
premature back then.

I've learned that some ideas may never mature. Micro-payments
is one concept I've been skeptical of since the beginning.
Why pay next to nothing for something when you can get it
for absolutely nothing elsewhere on the Net? Perhaps I'll be
proven wrong in the future on this. It won't be the first or
the last time.

I've learned to trust my gut. Hundreds of times over the
years I've seen schemes that were heralded as the second
coming whilst I thought to myself that they didn't make
any sense. One key is to simply say to yourself, "Show
me the money!"

I've learned that when it comes to technology people run
hot and cold. When AOL was down for a day it was headline
news at one point. Now, AOL is headline news for other
reasons, and people think the Net is dead. How ridiculous
that is when you consider how much time people with power
of the purse spend online.

I've learned to keep myself from being online every waking
hour. It's too easy to stare at this screen and literally
loose perspective. So, am I going to watch movies on my
desktop computer screen? Of course not. Maybe my laptop,
but not my desktop.

Are there other lessons I've learned over the years that
are worth sharing? Yes, and I'll share more of them in
upcoming issues of Web Digest For Marketers. They'll also
be posted at http://wdfm.com where you can find all
previous Publisher's Notes that have appeared in this
newsletter. LC

LISHER'S NOTE</b></font><p>

<b>Lessons Learned from a Decade in Online Marketing</b><br><p></p>

This year marks my tenth year of being in business online. My first endeavo=
r was The Online Ad Agency. There wasn't much on the Net back then, except =
for things like the Jet Propulsion Lab and other geeky sites.<p>=20

My shop was the first marketing entity of its kind. It drew lots of  public=
ity in Business Week, The New York Times, on CNN, CNBC, CBS and so forth. I=
t was a feeding frenzy. I was fielding 30 to 40 phone calls a day. I named =
it The Online Ad Agency because I came from Madision Avenue, where I was a =
copywriter for firms like IBM, AT&T and other blue chippers.<p>=20

It took me one year to realize that my firm shouldn't be an ad agency. Why?=
 Because the nature of that business is too labor intensive and wouldn't dr=
aw enough billings for the commission model to pay me and my people properl=
y. Some agencies are just now understanding this truth.  Some will never ge=
t it.<p>=20

So in 1994, I revamped my business model so that my company functions like =
a consultancy, where we get paid for transferring knowledge.  My revamped c=
ompany was renamed Chase Online Marketing Strategies Inc., which is the par=
ent company of this newsletter. =20

One proven revenue stream of this business is my speaking engagements (whic=
h I refer to as "mass consulting"), where I demonstrate to organizations ho=
w to get their money's worth from the Internet.<p>

One innovation that I brought to mass consulting is the 75-minute "Discover=
y Session".  Held weeks in advance, the client team and I brainstorm and na=
il down exactly what they want their attendees to walk away with.  (For mor=
e on this, visit <a href=3D"http://66.38.189.161/maestro/link/2495638423/2/=
13110/13088344/2/83319/1/1377/1382/lnk.htm">http://larrychase.com/seminars.=
html</a>.)<p>

After ten years, I notice there is still a chasm between ad agencies and co=
nsultancies in this medium. Ad agencies typically aren't good at techno-wee=
nie projects where piles of code are needed. Consultancies are better at th=
at, but not so hot when it comes to conjuring creative campaigns and execut=
ing them. That's where guys like me come in to bridge that gap.<p>=20

Over the years I've learned many lessons that I carry forward into my secon=
d decade online.<p>=20

I learned that what worked last year may or may not work this year or next.=
 Some things that worked five years ago, then stopped working, are now just=
 starting to work again. Why? Because five years ago it was too early for s=
ome ideas and now this medium has matured enough to embrace what was premat=
ure back then.<p>=20

I've learned that some ideas may never mature. Micro-payments is one concep=
t I've been skeptical of since the beginning. Why pay next to nothing for s=
omething when you can get it for absolutely  nothing elsewhere on the Net? =
Perhaps I'll be proven wrong in the future on this. It won't be the first o=
r the last time.<p>=20

I've learned to trust my gut. Hundreds of times over the years I've seen sc=
hemes that were heralded as the second coming whilst I thought to myself th=
at they didn't make any sense. One key is to simply say to yourself, "Show =
me the money!"<p>=20

I've learned that when it comes to technology people run hot and cold. When=
 AOL was down for a day it was headline news at one point. Now, AOL is head=
line news for other reasons, and people think the Net is dead. How ridiculo=
us that is when you consider how much time people with power of the purse s=
pend online.<p>=20

I've learned to keep myself from being online every waking hour. It's too e=
asy to stare at this screen and literally loose perspective. So, am I going=
 to watch movies on my desktop computer screen? Of course not. Maybe my lap=
top, but not my desktop.<p>=20

Are there other lessons I've learned over the years that are worth sharing?=
 Yes, and I'll share more of them in upcoming issues of Web Digest For Mark=
eters. They'll also be posted at <a href=3D"http://66.38.189.161/maestro/li=

OF THE WEEK</b></font><br><p></p>
<font face=3D"verdana,arial,sans-serif" size=3D"-2"><b>Repeat Yourself. Rep=
eat Yourself.</b><br><p></p>

Repetition helps reinforce key benefits in the mind of the prospect. Too ma=
ny writers think it insulting to repeat key benefits. You don't have to ham=
mer the same point home in lockstep sequence. That can be perceived as talk=
ing down to readers, which will have them leaving your copy or Web page qui=
ckly.<p>=20

Repeating key benefits throughout your copy or website not only underscores=
 benefits, it also makes sure that readers see them no matter where they en=
ter your package, be it a brochure or website. You don't know where readers=
/surfers come into you. In a brochure, it could easily be on the fifth or e=
ighth panel. The same is true for a website, where a search engine is likel=
y to show a page on your site that's six layers down instead of the top lev=
el home page. This makes sense, since there's probably more content on that=
 sixth level page than on your home page.<p>=20

Repeating yourself is also a good idea when you ask surfers or readers to c=
lick on a link. You want to reinforce that they've clicked over to the righ=
t place. So in your newsletter you may say "Click Here to Get Your Free Dow=
nload on Email Marketing Tips." On that landing page, it helps to say "Welc=
ome! Here Are Your Free Email Marketing Tips - Click Here to Download."<p>

So, remember, repeat yourself.</font><br><P></P><br>
