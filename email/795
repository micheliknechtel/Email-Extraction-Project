Subject: Calendar scripts for 2003 & later

Happy New Year, Everyone!

In preparing a newsletter each month, we use the PM calendar script... but
it doesn't go any later than 2002 in our version of PM 6.52. Is there
someplace I can download a newer script? It's no fun trying to do montly
calendars by hand!

Thanks so much!
Joette

This one should be the calendar_1 template we talked about recently
here. Just edit the script and add to the year list (there should be
two), respecting the format:

listbox 160,90,240,154,"1996","1997","1998","1999","2000","2001","2002","2003"

ciao

from creativepro.com:

When the clock struck midnight on December 31, after kissing the person closest to you, did you sit back and reflect on 2002? After pondering personal milestones and professional achievements, did you stop to think about what technologies and products made a difference this year? No? Well, have no fear because we did. Just before the end of the year, our contributing writers took a few moments to comment on the key events of 2002 and speculate on what's to come in 2003. Not surprisingly, the fireworks over QuarkXPress 5 and InDesign 2 topped many pundits' lists.

"As a palindrome year, it was hard to tell if we were coming or going during 2002. Certainly the year started off with a bang with the almost simultaneous (only seven days apart) releases of QuarkXPress 5 and InDesign 2. For the first few months of their releases, the competition was hot and heavy between the two programs. Most reviewers gave InDesign high marks while the scores for QuarkXPress were a little less positive. By the end of the year, though, the most scathing comment on the success of QuarkXPress was an e-mail from Quark Inc. offering QuarkXPress 4.1 for sale. Oh well, if you can't sell the new product, sell the old one."

Thanks, Carol. I was set to nomail for a couple of months and missed that.
Geoff sent me both versions offlist. He's sure quicker than the digest!
I so appreciate the help on this list!
