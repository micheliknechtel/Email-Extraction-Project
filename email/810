TODAY'S TIP: King James's Influence

The event that had the biggest impact on the 1606 production of
Macbeth -- and which may have been responsible for Shakespeare's
writing this play -- is the ascension of King James VI of
Scotland to the English throne, thus becoming King James I of
England. In May 1603, shortly after he became king, James became
the personal patron of Shakespeare's acting company, causing it
to change names from the Lord Chamberlain's Men to King's Men.
This patronage provided many benefits to the theatrical company,
including increased opportunities to perform at court and
financial assistance when the theatres were closed because of
plague. Because of this, some critics view the production of
Macbeth a mere three years after James's ascension to the English
throne as Shakespeare's tribute to his company's patron. Others
have argued the opposite -- that this play is more a criticism of
King James than a tribute to him.
