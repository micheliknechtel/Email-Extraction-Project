FLOWERS FOR WINTER FRAGRANCE
by John Richmond 

Even though it was twenty five years ago I remember it 
well.  I'd just moved to Plymouth and was walking 
through town on a February day when I was hit by a wall
of scent.  Sweet and powerful, it lingered in the air 
and brightened my day.  I had to find out what was 
causing it.  There seemed no obvious candidates until I
saw a nondescript little shrub with wispy white flowers
a few yards away.  That was the source, and that was my
first encounter with a Christmas box, Sarcococca.  There 
is something special about a plant that flowers in cool 
climate winters.  When it also has a powerful scent 
then it becomes very desirable.  It may have no impact 
for the rest of the year - but it's still worth growing 
for those brief moments that remind you that winter is 
just a passing season and spring will soon  return.

PRESERVING YOUR AMARYLLIS BULB

Your amaryllis bulbs will need some special care if they 
are to bloom again next year.  Cut off the bloom stalk 
(but not the foliage) and place the plant in a bright 
window.  Feed regularly and keep the bulb watered until 
all danger of frost has passed, then place the container 
outdoors in a partly shady area.In September, cut back 
the foliage and place the pot in a cool, dark place 
until winter.

Easy Flower Propagation? 
I am trying to learn how to self-pollinate and cross-
pollinate flowers. My question is what is the easiest 
if any to pollinate? And one that will produce seeds 
and are able to be planted soon after seeds are 
produced? If there are any? I know that most of the 
time when you do make a plant produce seeds it takes 
awhile for the seeds to be able to grow. but is there 
anything that will help me achive my thriving knowledge 
of PROPAGATION?

Peat Moss 
If I plan to grow vegetables and use spagnum peat moss 
in my garden, will I need to add anything with it? Lime? 
Should I not use Spagnum?

Brassicas in Containers 
Hi! I've got a bad case of club root going on in my raised 
beds, so want to try broccoli, cauliflower, etc., in 
containers. Has anyone tried this and with what results? 
(I'm not a big fan of reinventing wheels...)
