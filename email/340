TWO GOOD-VALUE WHITES

Let's turn to France today for two excellent, affordable everyday
white wines that for many of us require no introduction.

Year in and year out, I eagerly grab the new vintage of Hugues
Beaulieu Coteaux du Languedoc Picpoul de Pinet and Domaine de Pouy
Vin de Pays des Cotes de Gascogne as soon as they hit the local
market, knowing that these simple but attractive wines will provide
drinking pleasure and go well with food for a price that's right. I
only wish this could be said of every wine in the $6 to $8 price
range.

These wines gain in value, perhaps, because they come from what
some might call humble origins: Both are produced in Southwestern
France, well outside the more sought-after wine regions. And both
are made from relatively unknown grape varieties: Picpoul in the
Beaulieu, which is pronounced "Peek-pool" and translates as "lip
stinger" because of its zippy acidity (also known as Folle
Blanche); and Ugni Blanc ("Oo-n'yee BlaN") in the Domaine de Pouy,
a grape more often used as a neutral base wine for Cognac (in
Italy, the same grape is called Trebbiano).

These aren't wines to lay down for maturing. They are most
enjoyable while young and fresh, so seek out the most recent
vintage available, and drink them up over coming months. The 2001s,
currently available in most markets, are drinking very well right
now ... and the price is right.

HUGUES BEAULIEU 2001 COTEAUX DU LANGUEDOC PICPOUL DE PINET ($7.99)

Pale straw color. Luscious pears in the aroma and flavor ... ripe,
juicy pears, with a tangy snap of lemon-lime to provide structure
and flavor interest. Bone-dry and crisp, fruit and zippy acidity in
balance. U.S. importer: Kysela Pere & Fils Ltd., Winchester, Va.
(Jan. 7, 2003)

FOOD MATCH: Fine with seafood, and an excellent match with a
vegetarian dish, a cauliflower-potato gratin with Gruyere cheese.

VALUE: A consistent good value at well under $10.

http://www.kysela.com/

___________________________________________________________________
DOMAINE DE POUY 2001 VIN DE PAYS DES COTES DE GASCOGNE ($6.99)

This clear, straw-color wine offers distinct pear and apple aromas,
fresh and appetizing. Bone-dry and very fresh, pears and snappy
acidity provide a simple but refreshing flavor that makes it a
natural with a wide range of foods. U.S. importer: Robert Kacher,
Washington, D.C. (Jan. 1, 2003)

FOOD MATCH: Crisp acid and fruit made a happy marriage with an
Italian-style frittata.

VALUE: Hard to beat for this low-end price.

LOOKING FOR A 2003 WINE CALENDAR?

I have good news for those of you who've written to express your
regret that we decided not to publish another WineLoversPage.com
wall calendar for 2003: My Finnish pal Hannu Nettivuori, who
publishes the artful Wine of the Week website, one of the first and
still one of the most attractive wine-related destinations on the
Internet, is offering his personal wine-art calendar for sale this
year.

Hannu, who is an artist as well as a wine lover, offers 12 original
art works in the calendar - one per month - plus an additional
artwork on the cover to make a baker's dozen ... plus, as he says,
you get "the luxury of learning the months and days in Finnish!"

It's an attractive and fun calendar, each month suitable for
framing, and only 100 numbered and signed copies will be made.
Quite a bargain at 20 Euros (approximately US$20), including
delivery by first-class postal mail anywhere in the world.

To enjoy the Wine of the Week site, click to
http://www.nettivuori.com/weeklywine
Or you can go direct to the Calendar page, with a form and links
for online ordering with Visa or MasterCard, at

VOLUNTEERS NEEDED TO HELP TEST GRAPHIC EDITION!

After a two-year break, I'm planning to resume The 30 Second Wine
Advisor's HTML edition, an optional version that will offer photos, 
images, color and formatting in our E-letter for those who wish it.

I'll have more details soon, including information on how to 
request a change to the new edition. In the meantime, though, 
we're looking for a few dozen volunteers (or more) to help us test 
the new system before it goes into full production.

No special technical knowledge is necessary, but if you're willing 
to help by agreeing to let us send a few test issues to your 
E-mail box - and let us know if you have any problem receiving 
them - just drop me a note at wine@wineloverspage.com, and I'll 
put you on the test E-mail list.

Thanks!
