Please Help Protect Kids from Big Tobacco

Almost 90 percent of smokers start smoking at or before the age of 18 and kids spend almost a third of their waking time in school.   We need your help to stop this deadly cycle. Teachers and schools are in an important position to educate kids about the dangers of tobacco and prevent them from starting to smoke.  Some states have reduced middle school smoking rates by as much as 40%.  Our kids deserve the same access to these programs.  Click here,  http://www.educationworld.com/go/base?id=AEH to tell the Governor it is time to fund tobacco prevention programs in our schools and in our state.

StarrPoints: A Resolve to Be Better -- in Verse!
http://www.educationworld.com/a_issues/issues368.shtml
According to the most reliable online historians, the practice of making New Year's resolutions dates back more than 4000 years to the Babylonians. Apparently among members of that ancient culture, the most popular resolution was to return borrowed farm equipment. While it's always a good idea to return borrowed farm equipment, your resolutions for 2003 are more likely to reflect a desire for personal or professional improvement. Perhaps they even bear some resemblance to the resolutions expressed by the composite teacher in today's poem, A Resolve to be Better -- in Verse!   Whether you've already made your New Year's resolutions, or simply have resolved not to make any this year, we wish you a Happy New Year!
