                 CLASSIC COOKBOOK IS REVISED

The famous cookbook "Joy of Cooking" is getting a makeover.
The most recent update was in 1977 and the Denver Post says
the venerable in-the-kitchen how-to publication is coming
out with a new edition. Famous for its bright red-and-white
checked cover -- representing a tablecloth -- the cookbook
first saw the light of day in a primitive form in the 1930s.
It was a staple in millions of households through the Great
Depression and the War Years. In 1953 it changed its focus
from being "chatty" to having a more educational text and
presentation. The new update is, according to the publica-
tion, "more visual." The content is in keeping with the
push toward leaner cuisine and for people on diets and exer-
cise programs. This latest redo was carried out under the
supervision of the grandson of the original author.

             IMPORTED WINTERMELON ON RECALL LIST

An imported Chinese product called Wintermelon strips is on
a national government recall list. The product is packaged
in 12-ounce containers, heat-sealed in plastic. The Food
and Drug Administration recall is listed as F-103-3. The re-
call includes all products currently on the market national-
ly -- most of the distribution was in the New York area --
that were produced in the same batch. The importation was
done by Starway Inc. of Brooklyn, N.Y. The product is a com-
bination of the melon and sugar. The Wintermelon strips were
produced by the Sun Wing Hong Food Ltd. of Hong Kong. The
reason for the recall is that some amount of sulfites can
be present in the food, though no mention of that chemical
is listed on the ingredients panel.
