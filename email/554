Tip #2: How to get your guests to stay AFTER your business 
        opportunity meeting.

What's the most important part of the business presentation?

AFTER the presentation.

That's when prospects can ask questions, sign up, fill out their
orders, etc.

So how can you keep your prospects from rushing home when your
meeting is finished?

Try this.

About seven years ago, I was in Hong Kong. I had the evening
free, so I went to observe a local opportunity meeting. Every
guest was given a ticket for a chance to win one of three door
prizes. The door prizes were in three large, brightly colored
boxes.

When the meeting finished, the speaker said, 'Thanks for coming
to tonight's presentation. And if you are a guest, please take a
look at your ticket. We're going to have a drawing for these
three great door prizes. But first, let's take a 10-minute break
to stretch our legs, use the restroom, etc. and then we'll have
our big drawing.'

Well, the drawing actually occurred about 15 minutes later, but
all the guests stayed. That gave their sponsors a chance to talk
with their guests about that evening's presentation.

Tip from John Church in Thatcham, England:

Don't train your distributors with knowledge.
Train your distributors for action.

-------------------------------------------------------

Which sponsoring tool do I like to use?

I use the book, 'How To Get Rich Without Winning The Lottery.' 
This book soft-sells ordinary people and turns them into 
prospects. 

That's the hardest task. Once someone is a prospect, I find 
it is quite easy from there.

If you'd like some more prospecting tips, go to:

and you can read the free 14-page special report.

I especially like the tip on how to prospect by NOT answering 
the telephone. You'll love this short answering machine script 
because it gets even your shy distributors back to work again.

Fat Boys Report.

Why am I fat? Because I have so many friends. Friends like Karen 
DeLuca from Illinois. She gave me some wonderful Godiva chocolate 
bars, so I felt obligated to eat them.

Life is tough when you have obligations, but I am commited to 
meet my obligations :-)

Some other friends have asked me how my diet is going. Well, I
only have three more notches on my belt to go - of course I'm not
saying which way.

On the bright side, I did eat an organic apple for lunch. I knew 
it was organic because the worm was so healthy.

And Fat Boy Report member, Greg Arnold, reports a 23 lb. weight loss.
Some people will do anything to get mentioned in this newsletter!


More next issue.
