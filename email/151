> KIDS AND ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD)

Medical researchers say parents of hyperactive children often fear that giving
medication for hyperactivity to their kids could lead to addiction later on in
life. According to CNN medical correspondent Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, the findings
of a new study may ease the minds of some parents. “This new study, which was
published in the January issue of "Pediatrics," the journal of the American
Academy of Pediatrics, is reassuring for parents because they looked at all
the available data, and these researchers at mass generally found that, not
only did treating ADHD with stimulants not increase later substance abuse, it
actually had a protective effect,” said Dr. Fryhofer. “They saw a twofold
reduction in later substance use in children that were treated with
stimulants.”

Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, MD, MACP, is a general internist engaged in private
practice in Atlanta and appears on “American Morning” to discuss the latest
medical news on a variety of health topics.

> TAX CUTS AHEAD?

President Bush will call for the complete elimination of taxes on stock
dividends in the 10-year, $600 billion economic stimulus package he is
scheduled to propose Tuesday, a senior administration official said. Some
Democrats have criticized the president's plan saying the proposal benefits
the rich more than the poor. But according to Fortune's Andy Serwer,
Republicans claim that 37 percent of all Americans don't pay taxes.
"[Republicans feel] it makes sense to give tax relief to the Americans who
actually pay taxes, which are wealthier Americans," explained Serwer.

Andy Serwer is editor-at-large of Fortune magazine and appears regularly on
"American Morning" to comment on the business news of the day.
