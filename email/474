NEW FLICKS NEWSLETTER 
*********************

The Bay Area gets back in the swing of the things this weekend: The eighth annual "Berlin & Beyond" festival of German-language films kicked off last night at the Castro. It continues through Wednesday, screening such films as Marlene Dietrich's "Die Frau, Nach Der Mann Sich Sehnt" and Doris Dorrie's  "Nackt" ("Naked"). 

Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader will be at Yerba Buena, introducing Jean Bach's Academy Award-winning jazz documentary "A Great Day in Harlem" (Friday) and Orson Welles' "A Touch of Evil" (Saturday), then holding post-screening discussions of the films.

The Red Vic presents the SF premiere of Barbara Rick's "Sounds Sacred," an exploration of human connection with spirituality through voice and song -- from Benedictine nuns to SF's Glide Memorial Church. It plays Sunday though Wednesday, and the filmmaker will be at nighttime screenings.

STRANGE FRUIT

Filmmaker Joel Katz traces the history of the classic jazz song about lynching, which gained notoriety in 1939 when Billie Holiday performed it at the Greenwich Village club Cafe Society, then the only integrated nightclub in Manhattan.

The film features interviews, a score by Don Byron and varied interpretations of the song. Not rated. 60 minutes. 

Opens Wednesday at the Roxie.

An excellent documentary.
