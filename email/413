<p>
Few things are more precious to an enterprise than information. The
<br>
ability to use it effectively -- which oftens means sharing it
<br>
efficiently -- can separate winners from also-rans. But data also must
<br>
be protected from external and internal threats. Is it possible to have
<br>
both completely secure data and seamless integration?...

<p>
Holiday sales rose 24 percent over last year's levels to $13.7 billion,
<br>
boosted by strong growth in online clothing sales and changes in the
<br>
makeup of the Web shopping population, according to a new report from
<br>
Goldman Sachs, Harris Interactive and Nielsen//NetRatings...

<p>
Microsoft has announced plans to license its new digital media streaming
<br>
software, Windows Media 9 Series, at a cheaper price, for a greater
<br>
number of devices and across more platforms than competing standards,
<br>
such as MPEG-4...

<p>
While highly complex CRM software seems to have lost favor with
<br>
enterprise executives, nuts-and-bolts CRM applications like workforce
<br>
management are building steam. "All CTOs in the e-commerce space face
<br>
the same challenge these days," Priceline.com technology chief Ron Rose
<br>
said, "and that's how to improve service levels while decreasing costs..."

<p>
It has been a tough week for AT&T so far. The company has announced
<br>
plans to slash 3,500 jobs, or 5 percent of its workforce, and take a
<br>
$1.5 billion charge. Meanwhile, the FCC's expected plan to stop making
<br>
local phone companies rent their networks to rivals could be a major
<br>
setback for the company...

<p>
Telecommunication companies are putting self-service tools at the top of
<br>
their CRM project lists, according to a recent report by the Yankee
<br>

<br>
-- both landline and mobile phone companies are moving on self-service

plans...
