Dear Readers:

Things were looking mighty grim on the red carpet at this year's Golden =
Globes. Arrivals were over at 5 p.m. PT, and by 3:30 p.m., the biggest =
stars I had on camera were Bernie Mac (from the next "Charlie's Angels) =
and Sean Astin (Samwise "Sam" Gamgee, a supporting Hobbit in "LOTR.")=20

The accountants from Ernst and Young kept walking back and forth in =
their sensible shoes, conspicuously swinging their logo-emblazoned =
briefcases, but no one wanted to interview them. Catherine Dent of "The =
Shield" also walked the carpet until it was threadbare.=20

I was getting desperate for a good sound bite when I spotted a potential =
voting scandal: Access Hollywood had asked viewers to pick the dress =
that hostess Nancy O'Dell would wear for the evening. There she was, =
right in front of me, a vision in robin's egg blue, when I KNEW FOR A =
FACT that the viewers had voted for the lilac gown! With mike in hand, I =
bravely confronted Ms. O'Dell. She explained with a perky smile that she =
was changing into the lilac dress after the arrivals.=20

"Oh," I said. "OK."

Joan Rivers demanded to see the back of my hair. "Well," she sniffed. =
"It's better than when you worked with me."  (I used to appear on Joan's =
now-defunct gossip show. Her critique was a quasi-insult, I think.)=20

"Entertainment Tonight" -- which usually gets a prime spot -- was =
crammed into a teeny corner plot, and the producers were grumbling.

KTLA's Sam Rubin was giving out free M&Ms to try to seduce the celebs =
into talking. =20

Shirley MacLaine was getting sulky, and whined to her publicist, "Can we =
go now?" Jamie Lee Curtis, who years ago became bored with telling =
reporters who designed her dress and did her hair, was handing out =
pre-printed cards with the info.

Ashley, my producer, started walking up and down the red carpet, =
cleverly posing as a publicist, to see who was coming.

She came back breathless and wide-eyed. "Major news!" she said. "Lara =
Flynn Boyle is wearing a tutu!"=20

"What do you mean?" I said, my reportorial skepticism kicking in.=20

"I mean a pink tutu! I swear. With lace-up, high-heel ballet slippers! =
The crowd is going wild. This is momentous! Really, really huge!!!" =
(Check it out at http://www.msnbc.com/news/861573.asp#tutu)

I breathed a sigh of relief even as my palms got sweaty in anticipation. =
There is nothing worse than covering an awards show if you can't come =
out and say truly snarky things about someone.=20

It was then that the Golden Globes really picked up. The celeb crush =
came all at once: Nicole making =
I-really-want-to-talk-to-you-but-my-publicist-won't-let-me gestures to =
camera crews. Catherine and Michael wouldn't talk to most reporters, but =
she insisted they stop for the British press. Daniel Day Lewis, almost =
unrecognizable and still quite bald. Cameron and Salma and Edie and =
Beyonce and Renee and Halle appeared practically all at once and all =
looking fabulous. Goldie and  Sharon looking not so fab. Halle's hubby =
stroked her arm as she turned away. Nicholas Cage pointedly refused to =
speak with Us Weekly. Apparently, he's not thrilled with what they wrote =
about his mini-marriage to Lisa Marie.=20

When Lara Flynn Boyle pranced down the red carpet, your humble Scooper =
reached new lows -- and, Dear Readers, I've stooped pretty darned low -- =
trying to get a sound bite.=20

"Lara, PLEASE, over here! Show us your dress! Wave to our camera! =
PLEASE!"

Faye Dunaway watched my performance with a mixture of amusement and =
horror.=20

"Lara! I'll get fired if you don't speak with me. Please! My livelihood =
depends on you."

"Give it up," Faye said to me. "It isn't going to happen."=20


                      *      *       *


After the arrivals, we took our seats backstage. The Golden Globes are =
the best awards show out there because -- for whatever reason -- even =
the most press-hating stars come back to talk to us. A couple of years =
ago, Tom Cruise fielded questions, and the year before that, we couldn't =
get Barbra Streisand to shut up and sit down.

Meryl Streep came back and told us why she didn't want to meet Susan =
Orlean, the New Yorker writer she plays in "Adaptation." "I chose not to =
be confused by the truth," she said. She got off the stage, announcing =
to her publicist, "I really have to pee!"=20

Richard Gere also came back and talked. And talked. He talked about =
musicals. He talked about the meaning of life. But he was mercifully =
short when someone asked him the meaning of some string-bracelet he was =
wearing. "That would take about three days to explain," he said.  He =
also demurred when an L.A.-based online reporter asked, "Richard, why is =
gray hair so damned sexy on you?"

Uma Thurman -- to her credit -- also dodged an inappropriate question or =
two. "Are you wearing a thong?" a reporter asked.

"You're just going to have to guess," Uma said after regaining her =
composure.=20

"What's the sexiest Christmas present you've ever received?" asked =
another.

"Sexy Christmas present? Uh, er, gee?" Uma said as her publicist =
escorted her off stage.

Sam Rubin kept asking celebs if they liked their M&Ms.

Bono didn't take many questions because he was having too much fun =
pontificating without prompting. He discussed the racism of the Irish. =
"We learned from the best," he said. He told a not-short story about =
telling off a mugger who had a gun. He had been emboldened, he =
explained, because he'd just seen a Martin Scorsese flick.=20

Still, the press crowd was rapt. CNN's Daryn Kagan especially. She had =
this hard-hitting question for Bono: "It was seven months ago we were =
sitting in a bar in Ghana and you were singing the lyrics of this song =
to me. How do you feel about that now?"

Bono hemmed and hawed a bit. When he left the stage, Daryn was waiting =
with open arms, which she threw around Bono. She was all over him like a =
cheap suit. Or perhaps I should say, like Sharon Stone on Richard Gere.

Jack Nicholson seemed to be enjoying himself immensely, and fielded even =
the most obnoxious questions with his trademark grin. His publicist, the =
ever watchful Pat Kingsley, seemed to be enjoying herself less. She gave =
him the "wrap this up" signal as soon as a reporter mentioned Lara Flynn =
Boyle. But Jack ignored Pat, and gushed about Lara. He also had kind =
words for Nicole Kidman, as Pat -- who also reps Tom Cruise -- watched =
stonily. As Jack left the stage, he was rushed by KCBS-TV's David =
Sheehan, who threw his arm around Jack's shoulder, and offered him a =
breath mint.

"That's disgraceful," Ashley hissed as Pat Kingsley struggled to wrestle =
Jack free from David Sheehan's iron grip. "Since when is it our job to =
make celebs smell good?" Now there's a woman after my own heart. For I =
am, as always,

Your Faithful Scooper,



Jeannette Walls
