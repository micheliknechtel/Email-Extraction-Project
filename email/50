<font class=subhead>Inside Dish: Pirates still seek Mondesi</font><BR>       
<br>
<font class=V12>
<font class=V11>January 10, 2003</font> 
<img    src=http://i.tsn.com/i/o/redbox.gif width=5 height=9 >

<br clear=all>
<p>
<font class=text><P>The Pirates are again talking with the Yankees about acquiring outfielder Raul Mondesi, whose $13 million salary next season would be paid by three teams if the deal is completed. The Yankees could assume all but $1 million of the remaining $7 million they owe Mondesi, with the Pirates paying the rest. The Blue Jays agreed to contribute $6 million when they sent Mondesi to the Yankees last season.
<P>The Pirates likely would play Mondesi in left and move Brian Giles to center. Giles appeared in a team-high 241 games in center for the Pirates from 1999-2001 and would be one of the top offensive center fielders in baseball. An outfield of Mondesi, Giles and the Matt Stairs/Craig Wilson platoon could be a major upgrade if Mondesi produces in the last year of his contract. Rob Mackowiak would assume a super utility role. . . . 
<P>The Giants need to reduce their payroll by $5 million, according to one GM, but they remain interested in signing free agent Jose Hernandez as an outfielder. Hernandez, 33, has made only 98 outfield appearances in 1,173 career games, but is a good enough athlete to make the switch. The Brewers used him almost exclusively at shortstop and third base the past three seasons. . . . 
<P>The Marlins offered 1B/OF Kevin Millar a contract because Japan's Chunichi Dragons considered a signed player more desirable than a free agent. Chunichi will pay the Marlins $1.3 million for Millar when they could have saved that money by signing a free agent like Alex Ochoa. Millar received a two-year, $6.2 million contract with a $3 million player option and $500,000 in incentives each season -- far more than the one-year, $1 million deals awarded to two similar major-league free agents, Robert Fick and Brad Fullmer. Unlike major-league clubs, Japanese teams offer performance-based incentives. Millar's deal includes incentives that kick in at each of the following plateaus - a .280 batting average, 20 homers and 60 RBIs.
<P>The ice-cold market continues to infuriate agents. The identical Fick and Fullmer signings indicate that teams are "slotting" players at certain positions. "Let's make a wild guess as to what David Ortiz is going to get," one agent says, adding sarcastically, "I'd be really surprised if he signed for $1 million." The Red Sox worked out Ortiz at first base, and he has replaced Millar on their wish list.
<P>The Braves believe that first base is Fick's best defensive spot, and GM John Schuerholz says, "We think his offense will really come on at that position." One scout, however, says Fick is a defensive liability wherever he plays. "Too many people take for granted that first base is easy to play," the scout says. "It's an instinctive position. The Phillies learned that Jeremy Giambi had no instincts to play first base." Fick's defensive shortcomings concerned the Mariners. The Angels pursued him before re-signing Fullmer, but Fick wanted to play every day. His late-inning defensive replacement will be Julio Franco. . . . 
<P>An executive who knows the Mets' Jeromy Burnitz fears that the right fielder will experience another difficult season in New York. "He's not cut out to play there," the executive says. "He mentally beats himself up when people boo him. He's the type who will say, 'I do stink.' You say that long enough, it comes true. And people don't realize, Shea Stadium is a hard place to hit. He needs to go to a ballpark where his flyballs will be home runs, not outs." . . . 
<P>One executive is skeptical of Reds manager Bob Boone's claim that third baseman Brandon Larson "can hit 40 home runs." "I've got to see that to believe it," the executive says. "I don't think he's the player they think he is." Larson hit 25 homers in 297 at-bats at Class AAA Louisville last season and four in 51 at-bats with the Reds. The executive, however, believes that 12 to 15 homers is a more realistic projection than 40. . . . 
<P>The Mariners, looking for another bat, are interested in free-agent DH David Justice. In 12 seasons, Justice has missed the postseason only twice -- in 1996 when he was injured, and in '94 when the playoffs were canceled. . . . 
<P>The forever bloated Rangers will pay relievers Jay Powell, Todd Van Poppel and Jeff Zimmerman a combined $8.7 million next season and at least $11.3 million in 2004, yet plan to use Francisco Cordero, Estaban Yan and Ugueth Urbina with late-inning leads. Zimmerman is out until at least the All-Star break because of elbow surgery. And get this -- Van Poppel and Powell both have limited no-trade clauses. . . . 
<P>Look for the Brewers to sign one or two starting pitchers in the Jamey Wright-Dave Mlicki-Todd Ritchie mold. They agreed with the Expos on one player they would trade for catcher Michael Barrett, but not a second. A possible deal for Yankees outfielder Rondell White never materialized, and the team couldn't guarantee Shane Spencer enough at-bats to keep him from signing with the Indians, who plan to use Spencer for 15 to 20 games at first base as well as in the outfield and at DH. . . . 
<P>Third baseman Vinny Castilla could become a $4.5 million backup with the Braves next season. Mark DeRosa will compete with Castilla at third in spring training, and Marcus Giles is the frontrunner at second. . . . 
<P>Lefthander Chuck Finley declined one-year offers from the Cardinals and Phillies, but plans to pitch in 2003 even though the custody of his two daughters remains unresolved. "We just haven't had the right proposal come along yet," says Finley's agent, Alan Hendricks. "I would bet a significant amount of money that he will play." One team with interest in Finley says it is not willing to part with a No. 1 draft pick to sign him. . . . 
<P>Blue Jays assistant GM Tony LaCava is emerging as one of the game's hottest GM prospects. LaCava rejected front-office overtures from the Red Sox and Orioles this winter to continue working under his longtime friend, Blue Jays GM J.P. Ricciardi. . . . 
<P>One farm director's report on Marlins minor-league first baseman Adrian Gonzalez, one of four players the Expos reportedly were set to acquire in the three-team Bartolo Colon trade: "He's a young Mark Grace, an all-fields hitter who has a chance to hit 20 home runs and be an above-average defensive first baseman. He's a pretty good RBI guy, a better hitter with men on base."
