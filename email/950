On Saturday, January 11, the Arlington County, Virginia, Department of

**********************************************

On Saturday, January 11, 2003 the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), in cooperation with the Arlington County Virginia
Department of Human Services, will host a mass vaccination site test.

During an infectious disease outbreak or a biological terrorism attack,
large portions of the U.S. population may require rapid vaccinations.
Saturday's test seeks to put to practice the models that have been
proposed for a model mass vaccination clinic.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency
Preparedness, in coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) is seeking 500 volunteers to serve as mock patients for
this exercise.  Volunteers are needed for no more than four (4) hours on
Saturday (either 9-1, 11-3 or 12-4) to go through the exercise clinic.
No real vaccinations will take place and volunteers will not be asked to
perform any strenuous physical activity.

The exercise will take place at Washington and Lee High School, located
at 1300 North Quincy Street in Arlington.  If you are available, as soon
as possible, please contact LCDR Peter Stauffer at 202-401-4672 or
peter.stauffer@hhs.gov <mailto:peter.stauffer@hhs.gov>.  LCDR Stauffer
will sign you up for a specific time block and provide more detailed
directions.  Because we need a certain number of people at each time
block, we ask that you do not show up without contacting LCDR Stauffer
first.

Thank you for your support.  I hope you will be able to help.
