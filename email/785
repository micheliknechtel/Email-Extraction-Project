1) NOTES FROM THE EDITOR

VRG Nutrition Advisor, Reed Mangels, PhD, RD, has been working with a
University of Massachusetts graduate student on a thesis involving
vegetarian options at quick-service chains. In January and February,
VRG is hosting an intern from Bennington College. A Dietetic Intern at
Yale-New Haven Hospital will do her special rotation at VRG later this
spring. We are thrilled to be able to provide opportunities like these.
It is a win-win situation for all involved. Not only do we help these
people advance their careers, but as they go out into the world, they
spread what they have learned about a healthy vegetarian lifestyle. If
you are interested in pursuing an internship at VRG, see item 9 below.
If you live in the Baltimore area, please consider supporting our
interns by volunteering to provide a place to stay.

On February 1, VRG volunteer Phil Becker will be staffing our booth at
the Bay Area Veg Fair <http://www.vegfair.org> in Santa Clara, CA. From
February 14-16, VRG friend Ken Ziff will be handing our literature from
the Vegetarian Dining Club booth at the Los Angeles Conscious Living
Expo <http://www.consciouslivingexpo.com/index.html> at the Los Angeles
Airport Hilton and Skycenter. Many thanks to Phil and Ken!

I should also remind all high school students and friends of students
that the deadline for applications for this year's VRG scholarship
<http://www.vrg.org/student/scholar.htm> is February 20th, so hurry up
and submit that application if you haven't already.

Correction: Eric Borgstrom of Opportunities & Options kindly e-mailed
to let us know that our review of the Fantastic Foods Simmer Soups
<http://www.fantasticfoods.com/simmersoups.php> was incorrect. The
product should be simmered for 20 minutes before serving--hence the
name. Thanks for the help, Eric!


2) IMPACT OF NEW ORGANIC LABELING LAWS - A SURVEY

Recently I (VRG's Co-Director, Debra Wasserman) visited a local
mainstream supermarket and noticed that more organic produce is being
offered. At first I was very excited; however, I soon realized that
most of the organic items were wrapped in cellophane wrap over
Styrofoam trays. Ten years earlier this same supermarket (then under a
different owner) had used the same packaging. Of course, few people
purchased the organic produce. People buying organic products do so
because they care about the environment and their health. Excess
packaging discouraged these individuals from buying the organic produce.

The current supermarket produce manager told me he had to switch
suppliers in order to be able to meet the requirements of the new
Federal organic labeling laws and regulations. He said this new
supplier was wrapping all its products to avoid cross contamination
from non-organic produce and to avoid fines if cross-contamination
occurred. The produce manager also informed me that organic greens
could not be sprayed with tap water (other greens are sprayed this way
in many markets today) and therefore are now bagged as well. He also
told me that they were proud to offer locally grown organic apples
during the autumn. However, he now realizes that they will not be able
to get apples from these relatively small local suppliers because they
do not own the equipment necessary to put barcoded labels on their
apples. This is necessary due to self-checkout counters where
everything must be scanned.

As a result of this experience, we'd like readers to share some
information with us concerning the availability of organic produce in
their local supermarkets today. If possible, please answer these
questions concerning your local neighborhood store(s). You can email
this to vrg@vrg.org

1. Does your local mainstream supermarket offer organic produce?
2. How is it displayed?
a. simply placed on shelves
b. packaged with cellophane or other wrapping
3. Since the new organic laws went into effect, have you seen an
increase or decrease in the amount of organic produce sold? Is it
marketed differently?
4. If you have a natural foods supermarket in your area, how are they
displaying their organic produce? Have there been any changes recently?
5. State and city/town were you reside
6. Name of supermarket(s)

Thanks so much for your help!


3) ANIMAL PLACE URGES WELFARE GROUPS TO ADOPT ANIMAL FRIENDLY MENUS

Animal Place, a sanctuary for "farm" animals in Vacaville, CA, has
launched the FOOD FOR THOUGHT - Adopting an Animal Friendly Menu -
campaign and needs your help. Food for Thought is a national campaign
promoting the adoption of a vegetarian policy for SPCA and humane
society sponsored events. The campaign asks two questions of those who
run animal shelters: What animals do we protect - and - Do we serve
those animals at our events? Not intended to coerce individuals to make
personal dietary changes or to change what we feed the animals in our
care, the campaign asks only for consistency in shelter-sponsored
events. To see how you can help, visit http://www.animalplace.org and
click on Food For Thought.


4) MEATOUT 2003 IS COMING!

The 19th Annual Great American Meatout is poised for March 20, 2003.
This national campaign is coordinated by Farm Animal Reform Movement
(FARM), a national pubic-interest, non-profit organization. Individual
events are planned and conducted by local consumer, environmental, and
animal protection groups. Across the country there will be public
dinners, cooking demonstrations, a congressional reception, and
information tables set up at supermarkets, schools, and libraries.

If you are planning on attending or organizing an event, don't forget
that VRG has brochures and books in quantity. Go to our materials list
<http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/materials.htm> to see the variety of
information available. We offer special activist prices for the books.
If you are interested please email Jeannie at jeannie@vrg.org with your
name, address, and the name of your group.

For more information about Meatout visit <http://www.meatout.org> or
call 1-888-FARM USA


5) SYSCO WILL PROVIDE TEMPEH TO FOOD SERVICES

Good news from the food service industry! Sysco, a major food
distributor that services restaurants and cafeterias throughout North
America, will soon offer tempeh to their customers. Sysco has made an
agreement with Turtle Island Foods to provide tempeh in bulk for food
service kitchens. VRG was pleased to provide quantity recipes to help
kitchens that are unfamiliar with the product. If you patronize a
restaurant or cafeteria that uses Sysco, please let them know that you
would like to try the tempeh!


6) RECIPE OF THE MONTH: Broccoli and Tofu Sauté

7) QUESTION OF THE MONTH: Soft Vegan Foods?

Whether it be due to an accident or as a result of oral surgery, we
occasionally receive requests for help from vegetarians who cannot eat
solid food. Nutritional drinks such as Westsoy's non-dairy Vigoraid
<http://www.westsoy.com/products/vigoraid.html> can be helpful, but for
people who aren't restricted to a liquid diet, there are many other
options. In the following excerpt from VEGAN IN VOLUME, Chef Nancy
Berkoff, RD,. <http://www.vrg.org/catalog/volume.htm> provides some
tasty ideas:


Creating soft foods is easy. Making them attractive and interesting is
a little more difficult. If you have a large quantity kitchen and an
equipment wish list, wish for a Hobart (also called a buffalo) chopper,
a vertical chopper, an institutional-size blender, and a hopper
attachment (with several blades) for your kitchen. For smaller
kitchens, food processors (with several blades) and commercial blenders
should do the trick.

Try to select ingredients that lend themselves to being "soft." For
example, root veggies (carrots, turnips, beets, etc.), hard-shelled
squash, all potatoes, grains, and most fruits tolerate being mashed or
puréed. On the other hand, summer squash (like zucchini) or leafy
greens (like spinach or collards) are a disaster when altered. Use them
as combination ingredients, not stand-alones.

For creamy, soft, pleasant textures, tofu and avocados are a vegan
dream. Since both are neutral they can be used to "texture" sweet or
savory dishes. Avocados are higher in fat, but it is mostly unsaturated
fat with decent amounts of vitamin A and potassium. Many patients
eating modified diets may need the extra calories. You can select the
fat content of the tofu you use in your kitchen. Tofu can be used for a
binding, a soft thickener, and even a moisturizer in casseroles that
are combinations of cooked grains and vegetables.

Make a light dinner entrée (or a heavy dessert) by layering puréed (or
chopped) peaches, sweetened tofu (buy it already sweetened or mix in
orange or apple juice concentrate), and avocado purée (small cubes)
into a parfait glass. Garnish with a spoonful of jelly or preserves.
Along the same lines, a breakfast "swirl" of cooked cereal, puréed
fruit, and avocado cubes is attractive and packed with nutrition while
being easy to swallow.

Bananas, berries, peaches, apricots, apples, and pears can be cooked or
mashed into flavorful sauces. Purée some fresh strawberries, sweeten
with orange juice concentrate, and use as a sauce for puddings or
cakes. Freeze this blend and have a cool, smooth sorbet.

Puréed vegetables, such as carrots or peas, and beans can be cooked or
puréed into a smooth, creamy consistency, perfect for soups and sauces.
Purée cooked black beans, season with onions and cilantro, heat, and
swirl in soft tofu, and you have soup that everyone will like! Potage
crecy is a fancy way of saying puréed carrot soup. Purée cooked carrots
with rice or rice cereal, dill, and parsley; mix in some soft tofu, and
you will have a soup that is pretty to look at and great to taste.

How do gingered white beans with butternut squash sound? How about
citrus oats or frozen apricot frappe? All can be made for textured
diets. The beans are cooked, tossed with cooked squash squares and some
mirin.[*] Cook it soft for the mechanicals[**] and serve over rice
pilaf, or purée it and serve over seasoned mashed potatoes. Rolled oats
(not quick) can be soaked overnight in soy milk with orange and lemon
zest, cinnamon, and soft fruit. It can be served, uncooked, for
mechanical soft diets and cooked for puréed. Combine canned, drained
apricots, soy milk, fresh ginger, and ice cubes in a blender for the
frappe; this item can be used for everybody!

The sky is the limit with texturized menus. You may find that you are
preparing the same menu items for the whole house!


[*]Mirin is a sweet rice wine used for cooking, and is available in
Asian markets.
[**]A mechanical diet (also called a "dental soft" diet) means foods
are chopped into bite-size or smaller pieces.
