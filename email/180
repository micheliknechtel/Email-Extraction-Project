Dedication


Such grief might make the mountains stoop,
reverse the waters where they flow,
but cannot burst these ponderous bolts
that block us from the prison cells
crowded with mortal woe. . . .
For some the wind can freshly blow,
for some the sunlight fade at ease,
but we, made partners in our dread,
hear but the grating of the keys,
and heavy-booted soldiers' tread.
As if for early mass, we rose
and each day walked the wilderness,
trudging through silent street and square,
to congregate, less live than dead.
The sun declined, the Neva blurred,
and hope sang always from afar.
Whose sentence is decreed? . . . That moan,
that sudden spurt of woman's tears,
shows one distinguished from the rest,
as if they'd knocked her to the ground
and wrenched the heart out of her breast,
then let her go, reeling, alone.
Where are they now, my nameless friends
from those two years I spent in hell?
What specters mock them now, amid
the fury of Siberian snows,
or in the blighted circle of the moon?
To them I cry, Hail and Farewell!

Akhmatova, Anna  1940.

Anna Akhmatova (1889-1966), the pseudonym of Anna Andreyevna
Gorenko, was a Russian poet recognized at her death as the
greatest woman poet in Russian literature.  Akhmatova began
writing verse at the age of 11 and at 21 became a member of
the Acmeist group of poets, whose leader, Nikolay Gumilyov,
she married in 1910 but divorced in 1918.

The Acmeists, through their periodical Apollon ("Apollo";
1909-17), rejected the esoteric vagueness and affectations
of Symbolism and sought to replace them with "beautiful
clarity," compactness, simplicity, and perfection of form --
all qualities in which Akhmatova excelled from the outset.

Her first collections, Vecher (1912; "Evening") and Chyotki
(1914; "Rosary"), especially the latter, brought her fame.
While exemplifying the best kind of personal or even
confessional poetry, they achieve a universal appeal
deriving from their artistic and emotional integrity.
Akhmatova's principal motif is love, mainly frustrated and
tragic love, expressed with an intensely feminine accent and
inflection entirely her own.  Her later work, influenced by
the political turbulence of Russia, took on some civic,
patriotic, and religious motifs but without sacrifice of
personal intensity or artistic conscience.
