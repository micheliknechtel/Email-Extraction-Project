 Unix Power Commands

 -Focus on Unix Guide Kathy Russell
 In Unix, tasks that are difficult or impossible in other operating systems are accomplished with a single command. Unfortunately, many Unix courses and books only cover the basics and man pages are often hard to understand. The Power Commands series of articles move beyond the basics and show the vast potential of Unix.

 Top Linux Distributions from your Focus on Linux Guide
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/BF3
 Linux is gaining more popularity as a desktop operating system. The problem that many new linux users face is deciding on the right distribution. These are my picks of the best linux distributions available for use as desktop operating systems.
 1. Mandrake Linux 9.0
 Mandrake Linux 9.0 is a powerful linux operating system. It offers new users an easy transition from Windows with understandable interfaces. Mandrake can also run as a server, the Mandrake Control Center saves time with centralized command centers for handling system services and security. Mandrake Linux 9.0 is the future of linux desktop operating systems
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/BF0
 2. Red Hat Linux 8.0
 Red Hat Linux has been a long time developer of linux operating systems. Red Hat has always been known for it's cutting edge technology and powerful server features. Recently Red Hat has made efforts to place itself among the best desktop operating systems available. Red Hat Linux 8.0 features easier to use menus and more unified look.
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/BF1
 3. SuSe Linux
 SuSE Linux 8.1 is the result of 10 years of experience at developing a linux operating system. SuSE falls into the category of one of the best desktop operating systems because of its versatility to be both a user-friendly desktop operating system and a high-powered server.
