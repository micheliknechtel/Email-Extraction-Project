Musical Vacations Are Sure to Strike the Right Chord! 
Whether you're a lover of classical music, rock, blues, or country, there's a
musical museum or attraction that explores each genre's history and celebrates
its most famous artists. Memphis' Sun Studio, Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame and Museum, and Seattle's Experience Music Project are a few of the best in
the country. So grab your bags, and get ready to tap your toes and sing your
heart out.

Sun Studio, Memphis, Tennessee
The giant known as Graceland may overshadow Sun Studio. But without this modest
recording studio, established in the 1950s, Elvis' mansion--and the King
himself--may never have been born. Wanting to do something special for his
beloved mother's birthday, a young Elvis Presley wandered into Sun Studio to
record a song for her. We all know what happened next for Presley but studio
owner and recording engineer Sam Phillips continued to work with emerging local
artists, from Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis to Roy Orbison. The unique sound
of these outstanding performers became the basis for what we know as rock and
roll. As the years passed, Sun Studio and Phillips jump-started the careers of
many blues legends as well, including B.B. King and Johnny Cash. You and your
companions can get a taste of this amazing history by touring the studio, which
is still active. (The likes of U2 and Bonnie Raitt have recorded here.) A gift
shop, Hall of Fame Gallery, and the Sun Studio Cafe, a cozy 1950s-style diner,
make this place a wonderful way to spend the day. For details call 901-521-0664
or visit http://www.sunstudio.com.

Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Cleveland, Ohio
It's called the "House That Rock Built" for obvious reasons. Indeed this I. M.
Pei-designed seven-story pyramid structure made of glass and porcelain is filled
with some of the coolest music and pop-culture memorabilia in the universe. Sure
to engage music lovers of all ages for hours, this high-concept museum explores
the careers of individual artists and chronicles the history, and social,
political, and cultural influences of music through multimedia exhibits, films,
and more. But, no doubt, it's the tangible items, the stuff of these revered
musicians that most entice visitors. Thousands of musical treasures, spanning a
century, abound, including personal items like John Lennon's report card, Jim
Morrison's cub scout uniform, Elvis's crayon box, draft card, Army uniform and
Gibson J-200 guitar, and Janis Joplin's 1965 Porsche. Also, you can relive your
hippie days and the "Summer of Love" via classic concert footage. U2 fans will
be pleased to learn that the group will be featured in a new exhibit debuting in
2003. Rock out! For more info call 800-282-5393 or visit
http://www.rockhall.com.

Experience Music Project, Seattle, Washington
Along with some of the best java joints around, this $200-million-plus
Frank-Gehry-designed architectural marvel is one of the Emerald City's top
attractions. What is found inside Experience Music Project (EMP) is just as
impressive as its facade. This fantastic, one-of-a-kind museum uses interpretive
and interactive exhibits to tell the story of popular American music. All about
rock and roll, visitors learn about its roots--from jazz, soul, gospel, country,
and the blues--to its influence on hip hop, punk, and other musical genres. Sky
Church welcomes museum goers with a wall of MTV-like flashing images accompanied
by booming bass. Other must-sees include the Artists Journey, a cool multimedia
exhibit that features sound, film, and computer graphics, the Hendrix Gallery,
and Sound Lab, the place where would-be musicians can learn to play a new
instrument, jam with others, or mix music. The main exhibit hall features more
than 80,000 musical artifacts, including instruments galore from guitars
belonging to the likes of Bob Dylan, Muddy Waters, and Kurt Cobain. Gaudy stage
costumes, rare song sheets and handwritten song lyrics, an impressive recorded
sound archive, film, photos, and fanzines from around the world are also
featured. For more info call 206-770-2700 or visit http://www.emplive.com.
