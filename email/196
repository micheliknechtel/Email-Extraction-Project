National Do-Not-Call

Plagued by unwanted telemarketing calls? Help is
on the way. The Federal Trade Commission is in the
process of establishing a national do-not-call list.
Other new regulations on predictive dialers and
caller ID take effect immediately.                    
http://aarp.post.intellimedia.com/UM/T.asp?A910.11771.1252.1.45193


New Look for Consumer Protection

AARP Consumer Protection has a new online look. Discover
tips on keeping your personal information safe, saving
money on utilities, and more. Check back often for the
latest scam alerts and other important consumer news.     
http://aarp.post.intellimedia.com/UM/T.asp?A910.11771.1252.2.45193


Brokerage Statements 

Everyone is examining their broker statements more
closely to figure out where the money went. The
North American Securities Administrators Association
has a guide to help you decipher the information your 
statements contain. (Adobe Acrobat is needed.)        
http://aarp.post.intellimedia.com/UM/T.asp?A910.11771.1252.3.45193


Car Shopping

Before you head out to shop for a new or used car,
be armed with information about typical prices,
repair frequency, what the “Kelley Blue Book price”
actually represents, extended service contracts,
loan options, and more.         
http://aarp.post.intellimedia.com/UM/T.asp?A910.11771.1252.4.45193


Report Fraud

Where should you go to report which fraud? Whether you
think it might be telemarketing, internet, investment,
or pyramid schemes, all the best links are in one place.      
http://aarp.post.intellimedia.com/UM/T.asp?A910.11771.1252.5.45193


Saving for College

College acceptance letters will soon be arriving
in homes of high school students. While this month
may be a little late to start a college savings plan
for 2003, families with higher education expenses
in the future should check out qualified tuition
programs.

Travel Tip: Watch for Extra Costs

Always ask for the grand total of travel costs.
Airlines, cruise lines, car rental and travel
agencies have been making headlines with new
surcharges and extra fees. Paper tickets, extra
baggage weight, fitness center, mini-bar, hotel
phones, rental agency shuttle, port charges are
some of the extra costs that can appear on your
bill. Ask before you book and check the statement 
before you pay!
