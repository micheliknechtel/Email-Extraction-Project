Hey, it's Paulie, 

Welcome to bloody Tuesday as the Brit-clits across the pond
would say.  Don't worry you Yorkshire pudding-eating, bad 
teethed fags--I'm not attacking your brotherhood in today's
edition of EJ.

No, that honor gets bestowed upon the madman across the 
water...none other than Saddam Hussein.  I loved watching 
the television reports of the sand-nigger Hitler telling 
the Arab world that the U.N. inspectors are spying on not 
only his rag-land of Iraq, but the rest of the Arab world 
in order to obtain "a full complete and physical occupation
of the Arab gulf."  

Saddam, Saddam, Saddam...you need to crawl out of Bunkerland
in your mountain cave--the paranoia is getting the better 
of you.  By the way he's acting, I have a feeling the madman
is getting nervous about the new round of Tomahawk enemas 
he and his homies are about to receive.

So in a salute to SADDAM (Stupid Arab Dictator, Displaced 
After March), we'll share some humor until his next televised
paranoid message is released to the rest of the world.  He 
really needs to go back to watching the Godfather trilogy...
he was a much more relaxed insane dictator back in those 
days.  Hey Saddam...you need to pick up the DVD version of 
the trilogy--the quality is much better and will look good 
on the 70-inch big screen you have in the cave.

Later, 
Paulie

SIGNS IRAQ IS GETTING USED TO THE BOMBINGS
******************************************

* Owners of Target franchises make plans to open stores 
  back up again.
* Instead of saying, "We are under attack, please take 
  shelter," citizens are now told, "Here we go again, you 
  know the drill."
* Everyone wears sunglasses all the time.
* Sarcastic giggling heard just behind live CNN reporters.
* Yesterday's lead headline in most Iraqi newspapers was 
  "NBA Lockout Continues."
* Instead of running for cover at the sound of the air raid 
  sirens, the Iraqis do the "Tomahawk Chop."
* Hussein's latest address to the nation included the line, 
  "We must resist the Great Satan, yadda yadda yadda..."
* Christiane Amanpour is being invited to rooftop bomb 
  watching parties all over Baghdad.
* Baghdad High's senior class has playfully painted a bulls-
  eye on the roof of the school.
* Iraqi Television Network preempts Hussein's speech to show 
  "Baywatch."
* Maps of Baghdad being divided into numbered grids and sold 
  on street corners to play "Cruise Missile Bingo."
* Baghdad weather girls point to the map and say, "Scattered 
  B-52 bombings and cruise missile strikes tonight through 
  the early morning, with light rocket attacks tomorrow, 
  clearing off by noon."
* "We could be killed by a bomb any second" no longer an 
  effective pickup line in Iraqi bars.
* Every Iraqi citizen has been issued a catcher's mitt.
* Students anxiously listen to the radio each morning to 
  listen for school closings.
* Even the ever-hilarious, "Sorry, that was me--must've been 
  those BEANS I ate!" jokes are wearing thin.
* Gag gift sales soar with the release of the new "Magnetic 
  Hat."

Q:  What's the five-day forecast for Iraq? 
A:  Two days. 


"What was left unclear...is what will happen after Saddam 
is gone?  Democracy seems unlikely, so the hope is that 
Saddam will be replaced by a more pliable leader, someone 
we can work with to keep the country under control, maintain 
regional balance of power. Someone sympathetic, secular, 
someone like, oh...1982 Saddam." 
 - Jon Stewart

Hello, my name is Saddam Hussein.  I am looking for room-
mate for my luxury suite in New York city. 

My suite is in a rough area, but that will not matter as 
we will be living underground. 

My suite is nicely decorated and has 2 machine guns, 7 hand 
grenade launchers, 3 toy clusters and a hidden cache of 
nuclear weapons. 

My hobbies are shooting the local cats and the locals, and 
I'm a member of Mecca Bingo. 

Please, if you are interested, do not reply to this email 
address as i have reasons to believe that my emails are 
been interfered by the CIA. 

Thanks, 
Luv...Saddam 
XXXXOOOXXXX

Q:  Why doesn't Saddam Hussein get hemorrhoids?
A:  Because he's a perfect asshole.


"More and more information coming out on Saddam Hussein. 
We now know that he has, like, 24 presidential palaces. 
Each one of these palaces of Saddam's has a dolphin pool 
and an amusement park.  Well, if you didn't think this guy 
was creepy before - now he's starting to sound like Michael 
Jackson!" 
 - David Letterman
