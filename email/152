3.  Weekly Tip:

Veteran entrepreneurs feel that the most valuable business lessons we
can learn come from facing up to our weaknesses.  Many business
leaders make bad decisions but never take the blame for them.

To some extent, business leaders all have habits of mind and ways of
thinking that repeatedly get them into trouble, and it's very
difficult to change them.  For one thing, they don't like to admit
that they are the cause of their own problems.  By working closely
with the leaders of your company, you may be able to convince the top
execs to admit where they lack strength and to depend on others for
help.
