My name is Scott Schulman and I'm the publisher of THE WALL STREET 
JOURNAL ONLINE. I'm writing to you because even in today's business 
climate I'm certain of one thing: If you try THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
ONLINE for two weeks FREE you'll want to make it part of your daily 
business news and information routine.

In fact, our experience tells us 90% of the people who begin a 
two-week trial remain as subscribers, which is one reason we've 
grown 
to more than 600,000 subscribers.

That's why I invite you to try 2 weeks of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
ONLINE - WITHOUT BEING BILLED. If you don't like what you see, simply 
cancel. You pay nothing.

Sign up right now at http://wsj.com/govalue/em01326


During your 2 free weeks you can benefit from all the news THE 
WALL STREET JOURNAL is famous for ...and you can try all the exclusive 
online services:

* FASTER - Get continuously updated news and information from the 
editors of the Journal and follow top stories throughout the day.
* MORE PERSONAL - so you can track your portfolio at a glance, along 
with companies, industries, markets, and columns of interest.
* SMARTER - Dig deeper into the day's news using company information 
and related links included with articles.
* EASIER - Find what you need more easily with improved navigation and 
spend less time searching.
* SEARCH PAST EDITIONS - With access to articles from the past 30 
days, you'll never miss a story.

Sign up now. If you like THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE, (and I'm 
confident you will) you can get a full year for just $59*. That is 
$20 OFF the standard price of $79 per year.

If you already subscribe to the print version of THE WALL STREET 
JOURNAL or BARRON'S, your online rate for an annual subscription is 
just $39.

Remember, there is absolutely NO RISK, and NO COMMITMENT TO 
CONTINUE.
