Dear Fellow Ailurophile! 

Happy Tuesday, Cat Lover!

Today I'm going to tell you everything you ever 
wanted to know about the Tonkinese breed, but 
were afraid to ask!  Since I am owned by a lively 
"Tonk" named Peavey, I can tell you first hand 
what a joy this breed is.  He keeps us royally
entertained with his non-stop antics, quite 
unlike any other cat I've ever known.  Caesar, 
Tribble, and Callie are precious to me in their 
own sweet ways, but Peavey the Tonkinese is very 
unique indeed! 

Then to end it up I have another "catty" expression
for you to add to your cat vocabulary.  Have fun!
See you Friday!

Enjoy! 
Kit and the Fab Four

--THE LIVELY AND LOVABLE TONKINESE:
 
The Tonkinese originated in Canada, the only cat breed to do 
so.  (Thank you Canada!) It came about in the early 1960's as 
a result of a seal point Siamese and a sable Burmese cross 
breeding. It has many of the best qualities of both. 

The breeder of the Tonkinese thought the show Siamese were 
becoming too extreme. She tried to create a cat with qualities 
she liked best in both the Siamese and Burmese breeds. A pet 
shop owner in the U.S. had the same goal and called his cats 
Golden Siamese. The Canadian cat took this name but then 
changed it to Tonkinese. In the mid 1960's the Canadian Cat
Association recognized this cat as a championship competitor. 
The United States granted recognition in 1972. In Britain the 
Tonkinese is only recognized by one cat association. 

The "Tonk" is a medium sized cat that is shaped between the 
Burmese and the Siamese.  He is muscular and firm with slender 
legs that are in proportion to its body.  The Tonkinese eyes 
are aquamarine to turquoise in color, a very distinct feature 
of this cat.  The colors resulted from the crossing of the 
blue-eyed Siamese and the golden-eyed Burmese.  Tonks have 
a shiny luxurious coat which in medium short and fine and 
silky. 

The Tonkinese is an  gregarious, lively cat with a sense of 
humor. These cats are firmly convinced that humans were put 
on earth to love them; these are the cats that know where 
they belong. They purred their way through seven years and
 four presentations to the board of directors of The Cat 
Fanciers’ Association in their pursuit of championship status, 
achieving their goal in 1984. 

The colorful personality of the Tonkinese make them ideal
companions. They will take possession of your lap and shoulder, 
and will supervise your activities. They are warm and loving, 
highly intelligent, with an incredible memory and senses 
that are akin to radar. They are strong willed, and their 
humans are wise to use persistent persuasion in training 
them.

--THE LIVELY AND LOVABLE TONKINESE..continued:
 
Tonks are naturals at inventing and playing games, using 
favorite toys to play fetch, and delighting in games of tag 
with each other. Of course hide ‘n seek is a favorite game, 
which they play with humans as well as other Tonks. They 
become your "door greeter" and will happily entertain your 
guests. They have been described by enthusiastic owners as 
part puppy (following their owner around the house), part 
monkey (their "acrobatics" are legend!), and can sound like 
an elephant running through your house when they choose. In 
short, they quickly take over and run your house and your 
life!  Their affectionate ways are impossible to ignore, and 
they quickly endear themselves to family and visitors. 

These are indoor only cats, and a thorough inspection of 
your home prior to your Tonks’ arrival is important to make 
certain screens and doors are secured.  This will help 
insure they remain indoors. 

"Cat proofing" your home, in the dame way you would for a 
two-year old human on the loose, is bound to save you 
frustration. Toys and an interesting cat tree will help keep 
them occupied when you have other things to do besides playing 
with your Tonk. Working humans find two Tonks will keep 
each other company as well as lessen the mischief one bored 
Tonk can get into. This breed is healthy and lives a very
long life.   He is also a good traveling companion.

Tonks wear a rainbow of colors.  For championship show only 
five colors are allowed.  They are blue mink, champagne mink, 
honey mink, natural mink, and platinum mink.  There are some 
groups that will allow colors like the pointed Siamese or 
Burmese.

In all, no matter which color in whatever coat pattern you 
may choose, be assured you are joining an enthusiastic fan 
club of admirers of this breed. If you decide to make one 
your own, just know this:  you are about to embark on the 
MOST joyyful experience of your life!  

(I can attest to that!)

--FROM THE "CAT SCRAPS" FILE:  A CATTY EXPRESSION:

  Ever heard the phrase: "Put the cat among the pigeons"?
  
  This is a British term expressing the same as the 
  American phrase "catching fish in a barrel."  This 
  means that something is so easily accomplished that 
  it is not sporting.  It can also mean to stir up 
  trouble.  

  When Britain governed India, a popular pasttime was 
  to put a wild cat in a pen with pigeons.  Observers 
  then made bets on how many birds the cat would bring 
  down with one paw-swipe.

  (I sure hope they don't do this anymore!)
