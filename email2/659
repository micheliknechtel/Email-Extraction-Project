WEBMASTERS TIP - A Search Engine "Secret"

Note: In code examples I add a period after each left arrow
bracket so the code can be viewed in all email programs. If 
youcopy and paste, be sure to remove the periods or it won't 
work.

Here's one of those so-called search engine secrets: Some 
searchengines will only crawl to two or three levels deep 
on your site. Bycreating a site map which lists every page 
of your site and linking to it from your index page, you en-
sure that even the search engines that limit the depth that 
their spiders crawl will still find all your pages, or, up 
to the maximum number of pages a search engine will index 
from any one domain in some cases.

Here's how a spidering search engine see your site:

Top: Index page
Level One: Site Map (and any page linked-to from your in-
dex page)
Level Two: All your pages, if you have a site map on level 
one.
Level Three: Who Cares! You win!

Hey, I've got another secret for you. Creating a site map, 
even for avery large site, is easy. There's a nifty free-
ware utility called Index Generator that does the work for 
you. See today's Software Spotlight for this gem.

COMPUTER TIPS - Export Your Favorites

Internet Explorer 5 and higher has a feature that allows you 
toexport your Favorites. If you export the entire favorites 
to a file(rather than to another browser) you'll have an in-
stant HTML pagefull of the links to all your favorite sites. 
This can be very handy as aback-up in case you have to re-
install IE, your hard drive fails, or you get a new computer. 
Just imagine trying to find all those sites again!

You might also use it as a link page on your site or as your 
startpage (of course, feel free to make boogiejack.com your 
start page too!). To export your favorites:

1) Go to File from the menu bar and choose Import and Export.

2) From the menu select Export Favorites.

3) Follow the onscreen instructions.

You can select an individual folder or your entire bookmark 
file. Choose a place to save it, and either accept the de-
fault name (bookmark.htm) or rename it to suit yourself. 
Cool beans! ...which are nearly as good as piping hot baked 
beans.

Until next week, remember the words of George Washington:
I hope I shall always possess firmness and virtue enough to
maintain what I consider the most enviable of all titles, the
character of an Honest Man.

I wish you well, Booj
