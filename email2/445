TOY STORY 2 - In this dazzling sequel to the 1995 hit, Andy heads off to 
summer camp, leaving the toys behind to fend for themselves. In much the 
same way Buzz discovered he is a mass-produced product in the first 
installment, Woody discovers that he is a valuable collectible spawned by 
a popular 1950's kiddie-puppet TV show, "Woody's Roundup Gang," when he is 
kidnapped by an evil toy collector, Al McWhiggin. Pick it up today for 
$18.94/VHS (after cash back rebate).

psychologist who is shaken by the sudden reappearance and suicide of a

THE GREEN MILE - Frank Darabont's second adaptation of a Stephen King 
prison tale (the first being 1994's flawless THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION) is

Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), a 1930's Louisiana security guard who works on 
Death Row. When John Coffey, a gigantic black man convicted of raping and 
murdering two white girls, joins the other prisoners on the Row, Paul's 
life is forever altered. Pick it up today for $13.99/VHS and $16.99/DVD
