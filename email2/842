Subject: Exclusive Coupons and Discounts from FlamingoWorld!

I hope everyone had a Wonderful Holiday Season!
Mine left quite a bit to be desired.
On December 23rd I was put in the hospital with a ruptured appedix.
Apparently it had ruptured in early December but I didn't know it. I just thought I had the flu.
I spent 8 days in the hospital and got to return home on New Year's Eve.
Thank goodness my husband Dave knows how to hunt down deals and he kept
FlamingoWorld up and running. And thank goodness I am now on the road to recovery!
The good news is that I lost over 20 pounds - I do not recommend this as a good 
weight loss method! LOL

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
