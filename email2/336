RESEARCH:

IU EXPERT SUGGESTS WAYS TO COMBAT SCHOOL BULLYING - Bullying is a serious
risk factor in school violence, but educators can make choices to address
this concern, according to Russell Skiba, an IU School of Education
faculty member and expert in school safety. "A Secret Service report on
deadly school shootings since 1974 found that more than 75 percent of all
school shooters had been victims of continuing harassment and intimidation
by peers," said Skiba, an associate professor in educational psychology
and director of the Safe and Responsive School Project.
