I hope your New Year was a happy one.

It was for me. With friends and family by my side, I watched my book
"The Blankenhorn Effect"
(http://www.trafford.com/robots/02-1082.html) finally become
available.

I asked for some marketing ideas before, but that was mainly
theoretical. Now comes the hard part.

And this is, no doubt, the hard part for you as well. Implementing
new Internet strategies is always hard. I personally find
implementation much more difficult than coming up with strategies,
and I don't think I'm alone in that.

So let's start the new year there. How do you settle upon an
Internet strategy, that is, how do you bring closure to the
discussion? And what are the steps you think should be taken
(details please) in transforming plans into action?

Dana,

I was a bit disappointed in your recent criticism ("clueless") of
the Australian High Court libel decision. Below is a recent response
I made to a post in I-Sales that outlines my "rebuttal".

Comments/debate (as always) welcome :)

>>What a can of worms! I can easily see Dow Jones' point that they
can't be expected to know the libel laws in every country on the
planet. <<

I have to say I'm having something of a "lawyer's reaction" to the
criticism of the Australian High Court's decision.

The High Court is on par with the US Supreme Court in terms of being
at the apex of the Australian legal system. It is comprised of a
handful or so of very well regarded jurists.

I can appreciated that US citizens, given their Constitutional
treatment of "freedom of speech" and "freedom of press" might react
to an Australian court holding a US corporation to task for
"defamatory" statements.

Two important points:

(a) It isn't the case that US (or any other publishers) need to be
apprised of "the libel laws in every country". Truth is universal.
Truth, as a rule, is a universal defence in such actions. The report
was erroneous. US publishers, like all others, just need to worry
about being right.

(b) I am somewhat surprised that no-one seems to be drawing
parallels with the ElcomSoft Co. Ltd. prosecution pursuant to the
U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. A Russian company, and one of
its chief programmers, neither of which is bound by US law, were
prosecuted pursuant to a piece of US legislation, after the Russian
programmer was arrested (by the FBI, at the urging of Adobe) when
attending a conference in the US.

Again, at least truth is universal - you say something untruthful
about someone, you can reliably expect that there may be
ramifications. In the ElcomSoft case, the Russian programmer/company
created a perfectly legal piece of code, yet were dragged into the
US legal system - on a CRIMINAL charge - due to a reasonably
aggressive piece of legislation that has no application beyond US
shores.

By way of background, it should be noted that the U.S. Supreme Court
last week stayed an order from California that forbade the movie
industry from suing a list of 500 people all over the world over the
issue of DVD copying. (http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-978985.html)

From:   R. G. Smith <rgsmith@c-gate.net>

You would think PC Magazine/Ziff-Davis would have somewhat of a
clue...

but that would be wishful thinking, wouldn't it?

I was looking for an old PC Magazine Utility, one of those written
by a tech editor and published monthly for years... since it was for
Windows 3.1, I wasn't surprised when I couldn't find it on PC Mag's
web site.

No problem... I remembered that old PC Magazine utilities are
available by ftp from sites like Timo's FTP://ftp.garbo.uwasa.fi/

Well, check this out...
http://garbo.uwasa.fi/pub/pc/pcmagvol/pcmagvol.txt

After nearly 10 years of hosting this public service, a lawyer from
Ziff-Davis sends an e-mail to Timo at the University of Vaasa... I'm
appending the text from the file.

pcmagvol.txt About the deletion of all PC Magazine utilities from Garbo

The chronology of the essential events:
--------------------------------------

Fri 22-Jul-1994: PC Magazine's editor at the time Robin Raskin
publicly releases a permit for noncommercial distribution of the PC
Magazine program collections to the program archives on the Usenet
news. [The public posting is included at the end this file]

Fri 22-Jul-1994: Garbo archives maintainer (Timo Salmi) responds
both on the Usenet news and privately informing of taking up the
offer, and lists the relevant arrangements at Garbo archives. [The
public posting is included at the end this file]

Thu 5-Dec-2002: Ms. Tara Garfinkle tara_garfinkle@ziffdavis.com IP
Manager of Ziff Davis Media Inc emails a litigious letter to Timo
Salmi accusing Garbo program archives of "Unauthorized [sic] Hosting
of Ziff Davis Utilities" and demands us to ".. immediately [to]
cease and desist from any and all actions to reproduce, distribute,
publish or prepare derivatives of any Ziff Davis content (including
Utilities) or parts thereof on your website." The email then goes on
to threaten with potential claims on damages.

Fri 6-Dec-2002: Ms. Garfinkle's email reaches Timo Salmi during what
is the Finnish Independence Day and thus also an official holiday in
Finland.

Sat 7-Dec-2002: Timo Salmi alerts by email the rector of the
University of Vaasa, the head of the university's computer center,
and the director of administration of the university about the
litigious letter from the PC Magazine. Ms. Garfinkle is informed of
the existence of a distribution permission.

Sat 7-Dec-2002: All the known PC Magazine material is deleted from
Garbo archives.

Tue 10-Dec-2002: Ms. Garfinkle is informed by Timo Salmi by email of
the deletion together with "guarantee[s] that in the future [Timo
Salmi] will stay away from PC Magazine, all and any of its
utilities, activities and anything else that may be related or
produced under the auspices of [the] Magazine."

Wed 11-Dec-2002: The relevant correspondence is forwarded to the
attention of the PC Magazine's Chief Editor Stephanie Chang
stephanie_chang@ziffdavis.com by Timo Salmi by email.

Thu 12-Dec-2002: The current account of the events information file
is first written to avert potential enquiries from Garbo's users.

Wed 18-Dec-2002: No responses to the account provided by Garbo
archives have been forthcoming from the PC Magazine to this date.
Ziff Davis, of course, have every right to withdraw the earlier
distribution permission, but their cavalier handling of the matter
feels singularly lacking in elementary civilized manners.

Subject: PC Mag files on the Internet

To all,

Thank you for taking the time to write regarding PC Mag's distribution
of utilities. The many letters I have received on this subject have
reaffirmed my respect for both the Internet and the power of the written
word.

Let me respond to the closest thing to an original posting I can find:

This message was posted on the SimTel Software Repository :

"Because of a claim by PC Magazine that it has exclusive rights to the
distribution of their programs on the Internet, the entire /msdos/pcmag
directory and some programs in other directories have been deleted from
the SimTel Software Repository."

SimTel's posting is in response to a column I wrote in the July Issue
of PC Magazine (page 30). In that column I wrote about the experiences
PC Magazine had while creating their WWW server. Our server is a
compliment to PC Magazine and a service to you. It is NOT, nor was
it ever, intended to be the sole source of PC Magazine utilities.

Posting the PC Magazine utilities on the Internet is welcome. PC
Magazine utilities can be copied, but are copyrighted. You are free to
make copies and distribute the utilities to others provided no charge is
involved. Making copies or using any portion for commercial purposes is
prohibited.

I am sorry, that because of some unfortunate wording, I may have
inadvertently confused some of the ftp administrators who subsequently
responded by removing the utilities from their repositories. I will
be contacting them individually to help restore their services.

I truly regret any inconvenience or ill-will that the column caused.
You can help me by posting this message anywhere you see people asking
about PC Mag utilities.

Thank you. I have subsequently restored the material to Garbo
archives. I am always pleased about a constructive resolution.

I have rearranged the PC Magazine material at Garbo so that it now
is in two directories. The directories are /pc/pcmagutil and
/pc/pcmagvol with the following descriptions

pcmagutl : Individual utilities and updates related to the PC Magazine
pcmagvol : The volume collections of the PC Magazine

From: Jaime Ospina <info@orlandotouristinformationbureau.com>

This really caught my eye.
First of all happy holiday's to all.

further damage? <<

To Rob:

The biggest problem is you have no interest in employees, customers,
or others. Your employees, customers, or others would not
necessarily rise so if you were more sensitive to their need and
input.

Being big chief smoking big cigar that's only temporary.

You have better invest in your revenue producing factors like
employees, customers, or others.

Try to smile and make friend and ask for INPUT!!

On the off chance that you have been sensitive to employees,
customers, or others.

Then start asking for opinions other than your mandates....it is
evident that staff doesn't want to work under those circumstances.

This is easily transmitted to employees, customers, or others which
is going to continue to bring your work into a deep 6 position
.....get my drift!!

== > TOPIC: HIDDEN SECRET OF WEB SITE SUCCESS

From: Kaitlin Duck Sherwood <ducky@webfoot.com>

>> That's what happens when you do this friendly, helpful stuff.
You're putting a human touch on business, and people respond like
the real live humans that they are. You have a wonderful time, but
suddenly you realize that a day, a week, has slipped by and you
haven't actually done any productive work for a long time. <<

Okay, I have two pieces of advice for how to respond to email
personally without it becoming an awful time sink.

First, write and store responses to common questions. This can save
you a lot of typing! Many email programs have ways to easily reuse
such text. With Eudora, look for "Stationery" (which is very
different from what Microsoft calls "Stationery). In Outlook and
Outlook Express, use "Signatures". (You can insert as many
"signatures" as you want, wherever you want them, so this works just
fine for templates.)

Second, be formal. I don't mean to use honorifics (or "Sie" or
"Vous" vs. "du" or "tu"), but to use a formal writing style.
"Formal" turns out to be, in many ways, a marker of how much context
the writer and reader share. If you write informally, then you are
sending the subtle message, "you and I have a lot of shared context,
we are alike" which isn't too far off from "we like each other."

So how do you write more formally? The easiest and most practical
way is to write your response planning to store it to use over and
over again. (You share essentially no context with an anonymous
future reader.) This has the fringe benefit of helping you build up
your response template inventory!

For an interesting but academic paper on formality, see

From: Marilynne Rudick <marilynne@ewriteonline.com>

Dana,

Thanks for your e-mail and a copy of your article, The Hidden
Secrets of Web Success. I couldn't agree with you more about putting
a personal e-mail address on a Web site. I think that having a Web
site is an invitation for customers/the public to contact you. I'd
like to see other contact information on the site as well--including
a phone number. It's important to give people more than one way to
contact you (e-mail may not be available or working) and some people
would rather talk with a human being, rather than sending an e-mail.

I believe that everyone deserves a quick response (I'm not sure that
10 minutes is a realistic standard!). We collected hundreds of
e-mails for our workbook, Clear, Correct, Concise E-Mail: A Writing
Workbook for Customer Service Agents (www.WritingWorkbook.com). A
good percentage of them don't answer the customer's question, much
less solve their problem. Many are non responses--totally off topic,
or send the writer back to the Web site to find an answer that's
probably not there. A high percent don't respond at all. (We're
compiling a sampler of customer DISservice e-mails, to illustrate
the most common problems we've found. I'd be glad to send you the
sampler when complete (next week!).

We've written about what we consider the essentials of good e-mail
in our book (Chapter 1: What Makes A Great Customer Service E-Mail).
On our book Web site, we've also posted an article. Elevating
Customer Service E-Mail from Adequate to Excellent
(http://www.writingworkbook.com/articles/) that gives our thoughts
on customer service e-mail. Feel free to use this article, or others
from our site on your Web site or newsletter (with attribution).

Like you, we have a lot to say about customer service e-mail! Let us
know if we can provide more information, or continue this dialogue!
