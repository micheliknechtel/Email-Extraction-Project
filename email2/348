The Scenery Hall of Fame reaches 1,000,000 unique visitors
	
January 09, 2003 
	
At approximately 4:10 PM EST, www.scenery.org recorded the
1,000,000th unique visitor. This number reflects genuine page
views mapped to IP addresses. While not completely accurate due to
proxy caching and dynamic IP, this milestone is significant. In
1996, our site generated 10,560 visitors in the entire year. Since
May 2002, we've recorded over 250,000 unique visitors. This
dramatic increase reflects the general proliferation of web users
and utilities (and the interest in Flight Simulation), but,
nevertheless, makes webmasters happy.
	
Our sincere appreciation to all who have used this site.
	
- Tom Gregor, Sr.
