BARELY MANAGING

No Leadership Here
By Jimmy Guterman

http://www.business2.com/articles/web/0,,46361,00.html

Before 9/11, publishers wouldn't have looked to New York City
mayor Rudolph Giuliani to produce a book on leadership. In the
year leading up to the attack, Giuliani was most visible for
disclosing a serious illness and locking horns with many of the
significant people in his life. But Giuliani's behavior on and
immediately after 9/11 catapulted him into the role of "America's
mayor," a spokesman for a city and country adjusting to a new
reality. This period didn't last long -- it ended the moment he
floated the idea of changing a law so he could retain power --
but it was enough to elevate Giuliani to the status of celebrity
hero. And in our culture, a celebrity hero can publish a book
about leadership, put his picture on the cover, and place the
name of the actual writer in small print beneath his own.

Giuliani's Leadership, written in collaboration with Ken Kurson,
is the first of two books he's contracted to write for Miramax, a
division of Walt Disney, but is itself two books in one. Chapters
about 9/11 and beyond constitute the bulk of the book,
elaborating on leadership maxims, nearly all of which anyone
who's thought about management for five minutes knows already.
Sample non-insight: "Making the right choices is the most
important part of leadership." This is a celebrity autobiography
with alleged leadership lessons as an overlay, not a serious book
about management. 

Giuliani may go down in history for 9/11, but his reports of that
day in Leadership won't burnish his legacy. He writes of
scrambling to have police protect both his wife and his mistress,
worrying that he and his loved ones, past and present, might be
targets. This aside reveals that Giuliani thinks everything is
about him. Throughout the book, Giuliani returns often to the
subject of 9/11, providing some relief from master-of-the-obvious
observations like "Decision-making would be easy if it were
always a choice between good and evil or right and wrong. In the
real world, leaders have to make decisions that are
multidimensional, usually between two or more imperfect remedies,
on criteria that encompass long-range goals and plausibility." In
other words, decision-making can be difficult. What an insight!
So I can save you $25.95. Here's a list of Giuliani's aphorisms:
"Have beliefs and communicate them. See things for yourself. Set
an example. Stand up to bullies. Deal with first things first.
Loyalty is the vital virtue. Prepare relentlessly. Underpromise
and overdeliver. Don't assume a damn thing."

Leadership is about strength, but it is also about expressing
strength through humility. In Leadership, Giuliani presents the
softer, more human side of himself. Nowhere here are we
confronted with the angry prosecutor who kicked off his first
mayoral candidacy with an obscenity-laden speech calculated to
endear him to protesting police officers. But, as with other
celebrity leadership books where the text is at odds with the
behavior of the author [think Sunbeam's Al Dunlap or General
Electric's Jack Welch], you need to pay attention to the man
behind the curtain. Shortly after the publication of the kinder,
gentler Leadership, city officials, trying to close a $3
billion-plus shortfall caused in part by spending during the
Giuliani administration, asked the former mayor to cut back on
his security detail: He had 16 police detectives, who cost more
than $1 million per year, performing such crucial tasks as
driving Giuliani's fiancee to the Hamptons so she could water her
flowers. That's a perk most CEOs would enjoy. But Giuliani held
on to it, at public expense, even after returning to a lucrative
private career. That's no lesson in leadership.
