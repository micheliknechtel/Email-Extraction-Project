WILLIAM SHATNER INTERVIEW
 At a time when most would be slowing down in 
 their lives, William Shatner is not only 
 extremely active, but he seems to have 
 launched his career into warp drive - 
 to use a statement his most well-known 
 character might say. DVD Empire got a chance 
 to talk to William Shatner recently and he 
 openly discussed a number of topics, 
 including the fun of Spplat Attack!, 
 the box office failure of Star Trek V, 
 and…believe it or not…aging and death.

EDITOR'S PICK ==========================================
 
EYE SEE YOU
 Rating: 3.63 out of 5.00
	Wonder why you never heard of EYE SEE YOU 
 playing in the theaters at any time? 
	Well, I would call that a just and ironic question. 
	It’s just because what is the movie and how did 
 they hide a big budget film with Sylvester Stallone 
 in the cast and it’s ironic because we did not “see” 
 a movie with the word “see” in the title. 
	Anyways, enough of that, because the movie did get 
 some very limited play and I mean Very limited because 
 it didn’t play most theaters here in the country. 
 Instead it played overseas (where Stallone is much bigger) 
 under the title D-TOX. It also has been released under 
 the title DETOX in the Netherlands where it did 
 considerably less business. It did not however 
 play in the United States under any form or title, 
 which qualifies this really as a direct to video thriller.

AN EVENING WITH KEVIN SMITH
 Rating: 4.33 out of 5.00
	At first, I was unsure about watching AN EVENING WITH 
KEVIN SMITH. I mean, I had always been a fan of his movies, 
but never a big fan of him. Thankfully a fellow reviewer 
here (Thanks Spooky!) at the site told me about this DVD, 
and I spent a decent Christmas day watching 225 minutes 
of Kevin Smith. 
	And yes, you did read that right because this DVD does 
clock in at over three hours, but I have to say it was a 
well spent three hours because Smith proves himself to be 
quite an adept speaker and his stories are filled with a 
healthy dose of self-deprecating humor and hidden punch lines. 
	The first part of the DVD worth mentioning is the menu 
screens. The scene starts with Smith walking out and staring 
at you. He notions you to choose a selection and then 
looks away. As time passes (and you will want to watch 
for a minute or so) he grows increasingly annoyed that 
you wont choose something to watch. Overall, it smacks 
of the early days of Sonic The Hedgehog, but a good joke 
is worth using more than once.

THE KING OF COMEDY
 Rating: 3.50 out of 5.00
	THE KING OF COMEDY is one of those brilliant films 
that didn’t take off at the box office but has become a 
favorite of theater fans and critics everywhere. 
	Like TAXI DRIVER, Martin Scorcese teamed with 
Robert De Niro once again to tell a story of rage and 
crazy dreams but this time they changed the casting. 
Robert DeNiro is fantastic in his role of Rupert Pupkin, 
but it’s a different type of fantastic because Rupert 
is more like the average everyday man who wants to 
chase his dreams, but failing that is content to live 
with his fantasies. 
	Rupert imagines himself to be the best comedian in 
the world. The self-titled King of Comedy, but the thing 
is that we never hear his act until the final frames of 
the film. Thus we take him at his word throughout the 
entire film and the punchline is that he has the viewer 
believing he is really funny.

I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE: MILLENNIUM EDITION
 Rating: 4.25 out of 5.00
	I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE: THE MILLENNIUM EDITION? 
At first thought I would have to say we need that like a 
hole in the head. 
	But, at second thought, I have to put more thought into it. 
Which would make it third, fourth and so on and so forth… 
	Anyways, if you think about it: this was a film that 
inspired a whole slew of knock-off movies all centered on 
the same revenge motif. It is also as notorious a film as 
there ever was. 
	Protested by every major film critic in the country and 
banned in Chicago, this was also the one film that united 
both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert in a common goal of getting 
it banned from their city.
