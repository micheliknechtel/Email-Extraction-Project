ONLINE SUBSCRIBER EXCLUSIVE FEATURES. The current issue of 
Consumer Reports is now online. Here are some highlights. 
http://www.ConsumerReports.org
-----------------------------------------------------------------

INKJET AND LASER PRINTERS
We tested several new inkjets, including some from Hewlett-Packard, 
which recently redesigned most of its inkjets. The Ratings of 
inkjet and laser printers also include previously tested models 
that are still available, including inkjets, laser printers, and a 
multifunction (or "all-in-one") machine that prints, faxes, copies, 
and scans.
http://cme.cr-mail.org/Key=968.FbR.W.J9NJv

FREE REIN FOR DRUG ADS?
You may well be swayed by false or misleading ads for prescription 
drugs. We list the kinds of loose statements you'll encounter and 
the drugs that have been cited most often for violating the ad rules.
http://cme.cr-mail.org/Key=968.FbR.X.J2stMf

VACUUMS: PERFORMANCE OR PIZZAZZ?
There are several fine performers and one CR Best Buy in the Ratings 
of uprights and canisters. But our tests show that some of the 
newest vacuums push style over substance.
http://cme.cr-mail.org/Key=968.FbR.Y.NJYbym

SEVEN SOUP STANDOUTS 
When store-bought soup is good, it's very, very good. You can find 
one excellent and three very good vegetable/minestrones, two 
delicious chicken noodles, and a dandy clam chowder in our Ratings.
http://cme.cr-mail.org/Key=968.FbR.Z.H4621X

PREGNANCY & OVULATION TEST KITS
