=========================================


1.   COMMENTARY

In considering the prospects for the Biotech sector in 2003, there appears
to be little excitement -- and this might be the right medicine.  In late
2001, Biotech stocks were performing well despite weakness in the Nasdaq
Composite; there was still much investment fervor for the sector.  At that
time, six Biotech stocks were added to the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX) to
replace downtrodden internet dotcoms.  The change increased the NDX's
Biotech representation to 18 stocks and a 15% market-cap weighting.  Back
then, many large-cap Biotechs were still trading above $50 per share and
the sector appeared poised to keep the NDX from falling too hard. 
Unfortunately, in early 2002, there were too many disappointments on the
drug development front and stock prices trickled lower throughout the
year.  Finally, last month, six Biotech securities were pulled out of the
NDX thereby bringing the Biotech representation back to 12.

Today, the investment enthusiasm appears subdued.  In fact, a Salomon
Smith Barney analyst downgraded the entire Biotech sector to Marketweight
from Overweight, claiming a lack of upcoming medical meetings and FDA
decisions.  Well, we might not observe a general rise among all Biotech
stocks this year, as occurred in 1999/2000, but it seems that the greatest
declines in share prices already have occurred and there will be many
developments this year to lift specific stocks.

Next week, GENZYME (GENZ, $32, up 4%) and TRANSKARYOTIC THERAPIES (TKTX,
$9, down 12%) will meet with an FDA advisory committee to discuss their
drug applications for the treatment of Fabry disease.  Both firms already
market their respective drugs in Europe, but there is the potential for
one of these companies to gain a seven-year marketing exclusivity in the
U.S.  Later in the week, Genzyme and BIOMARIN (BMRN, $6, up 1%) will meet
with another advisory panel to discuss their Aldurazyme drug application
for the treatment of MPS I, a rare genetic disease where carbohydrates do
not get fully broken down in cells.  Finally, BIOGEN (BGEN, $42, up 2%)
should soon hear about the FDA's decision regarding Amevive's approval for
the treatment of psoriasis.

One of the positive aspects about the Biotech sector is that the largest
firms continue to deliver solid earnings.  GENENTECH (DNA, $35, up 3%)
will kick-off the earnings season next week and the firm is expected to
match analysts' estimates.  Earnings for Genentech and IDEC
PHARMACEUTICALS (IDPH, $34, up 1%) have been supported in the past by
strong sales of the cancer drug Rituxan.  This year, Genentech not only
needs good earnings but also must deliver on its product pipeline.  Last
month, the company submitted applications to the FDA for its asthma drug
Xolair (in collaboration with XOMA, (XOMA, $4, unch.) and its psoriasis
drug Raptiva.  Later this year, the firm will present Phase III clinical
data on its cancer drugs Avastin and Tarceva (in collaboration with OSI
Pharmaceuticals (OSIP, $17, unch.).

Biotech giant AMGEN (AMGN, $50, up 3%) recently lifted 2003 earnings
guidance because of increasing sales of its second-generation drugs
Aranesp and Neulasta.  Also, the company will begin to increase Enbrel
production due to the recent approval of a new manufacturing facility. 
Amgen is growing earnings at a 30% clip, which is substantially higher
than most large drug firms.

Genzyme announced that fourth quarter revenue would nearly reach $300
million due to robust sales of Cerezyme (to treat Gaucher disease) and
improving sales of Fabrazyme.  Several weeks ago, the company lowered 2002
earnings guidance due to poor sales of Renagel, a drug for treating
kidney-dialysis patients.  However, the inventory levels were simply too
high and the company is now in better control of the situation.  MEDIMMUNE
(MEDI, $29, up 3%) should hear about FDA approval for its influenza
vaccine FluMist vaccine toward the end of the first quarter.  The drug
received a positive recommendation from an FDA advisory panel, but is
likely to be indicated for individuals between ages 5 and 49 (thus leaving
out two huge populations: the elderly and very young children).

There will be plenty more exciting developments in the Biotech arena this
year.  We look for more stability in the sector and for the large-cap
Biotechs to provide some leadership.  When the large-cap stocks take the
lead, investment monies will begin to spread into the smaller stocks,
which will lead to sustainable rallies.

2.   THE BIO-TECHNICAL CORNER

The Amex Biotech Index (BTK) finally showed some positive activity this
week, but it's too early to discern whether the downward trend has
changed.  The BTK closed the week above both its 20 and 50 day moving
averages (DMA), which is an encouraging sign.  We expect the BTK to now
challenge its 200 DMA, which is only 10 points higher at 367.  The test
will be to see whether the BTK can remain above the 200 DMA and even
advance to the previous high at 380.

The technical indicators of relative strength (RSI), moving average
convergence divergence (MACD) and commodity channel index (CCI) are
beginning to improve and there's certainly more room for further gains.

It is important to remember that chart patterns are only accurate for the
past and values for support and resistance points are not set in stone. 
Many times a stock price will move below a moving average, but then
quickly turn higher into a more positive position.  In addition, there are
always new external factors that can greatly influence stock activity.

In our previous newsletter edition, we proposed that the late-October low
near 340 was the critical value to monitor as a technical support point
for the BTK.  During the last week of December, the BTK violated the 340
value by closing near 335.  On a purely technical basis, we would have
predicted that the BTK was going to move lower, possibly to previous lows
near 310.  Well, a couple of positive days does not make a trend, but we
are more encouraged by the BTK's recent performance.

http://www.BullMarket.com/tdbi/charts/btk011003.gif

We continue to monitor the Biotech Bullish Percent value (BPBIOM, provided
by www.dorseywright.com) to gauge investor sentiment.  The Bullish Percent
simply reflects the percent of stocks in a sector that are in bullish
point and figure chart patterns.  As stock demand for a sector increases,
more stocks enter bullish patterns and the Bullish Percent value rises. 
As a guideline, a sector is considered to be overbought or oversold when
the Bullish Percent moves above 70% or below 30%, respectively.  For the
Biotech sector, the BPBIOM is derived from an equal-weighting of
approximately 160 stocks.

In our previous newsletter, we provided an update to the Biotech Bullish
Percent value because the indicator made a short-term reversal to a
negative bias (a new column of Os from 44% to 38% bullish).  Since that
time, further weakness in Biotech stocks has dropped the Bullish Percent
to 33%.

At this point, it is difficult to gauge whether the investment bias is
going to improve or get worse.  Generally, we are more confident about
trend reversals occurring at extreme Bullish Percent values, such as above
60% or below 20%.  At the extremes, reversals tend to be more of a
long-term nature lasting several months.  For now, the BPBIOM suggests
that investors should be cautious about establishing new positions in the
Biotech sector.  An updated BPBIOM chart can be viewed at
http://www.BullMarket.com/tdbi/chart624.htm.

3.   NEWS IN THE BIOTECH SECTOR

MILLENNIUM PROVIDES FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FOR 2003
MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS (MLNM, $9, up 4%) projects higher revenue for
2003, but indicates that losses will widen due to increases in R&D
spending.  The company expects Integrilin sales to increase 20% in 2003 to
$365 million, but this revenue stream will not be sufficient to counter
the expenses associated with conducting clinical trials.  In fact,
management now projects that the firm will reach the breakeven point in
2006 instead of 2004.  The company still projects for Integrilin sales to
reach $500 million in 2005.

Millennium's most advanced drug candidate is Velcade and the firm plans to
submit a new drug application to the FDA early this year.  Velcade has
been evaluated in Phase II studies for the treatment of multiple myeloma
and additional trials have been launched to evaluate Velcade's efficacy on
solid tumors.

Millennium continues to expand its number of ongoing clinical trials and
this has been the primary reason for the increasing operating expenses
each quarter.  Apparently, investors are now accustomed to the firm's
greater losses because the share price did not decline on the news.  Apart
from general market conditions this year, Millennium's stock performance
will mostly be tied to the firm securing a partner for Velcade's
commercialization and getting the drug approved as a treatment for
multiple myeloma.


CV THERAPEUTICS SUBMITS DRUG APPLICATION
CV THERAPEUTICS (CVTX, $20, up 10%) submitted a new drug application to
the FDA for Ranexa in the treatment of chronic angina.  Ranexa, which
partially inhibits fatty acid oxidation, would represent the first in a
new class of anti-anginal therapy in more than 20 years.  Chronic angina
is a serious and potentially debilitating heart condition, usually
associated with coronary artery disease and marked by repeated and
sometimes unpredictable attacks of chest pain.  Approximately 6.4 million
people in the U.S. live with chronic angina, with an additional 400,000
people newly diagnosed each year.

4.   PORTFOLIO-SPECIFIC NEWS

APPEALS COURT RULING FAVORS AMGEN AND EPOGEN PATENTS
A U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has upheld the decision of
a lower District Court in ruling that TRANSKARYOTIC THERAPIES (TKTX, $9,
down 12%) infringed two of AMGEN'S Epogen patents.  While the Appeals
Court remanded a couple of rulings back to the District Court for a final
decision, the infringement judgments should just about shut the door on
Transkaryotic's attempt to bring Dynepo, an anti-anemia drug, to the U.S.
market.

Why did Transkaryotic's management ever believe that they could challenge
Amgen's Epogen patents and win the right to market Dynepo?  After all,
Dynepo and Epogen are essentially the same erythropoietin (EPO) molecule. 
The key for Transkaryotic, and the basis for the firm's existence, is that
its technology uses a novel method for producing therapeutic proteins. 
The strategy involves the direct insertion of genetic elements into a
cell's DNA to "turn on" a specific gene, thereby making a specific
protein.  This process differs from traditional cloning methods for
protein production where the gene encoding a therapeutic protein is first
isolated from a cell, genetically modified to improve expression (protein
production) and then reinserted into a mammalian cell for mass production.
 Since Transkaryotic's methods do not involve gene isolation, or
traditional cloning schemes, management believes that they have a valid
basis to produce marketed protein therapeutics previously created through
gene cloning.

The problem for Transkaryotic is that the firm is basically using its
technology to develop protein drugs that are already on the market.  Sure,
the firm is using a different means to produce its drug, but in the end,
it is replicating what already exists.  With Amgen's many patents covering
both the process for producing Epogen and Epogen itself, it was difficult
for Transkaryotic to not infringe at least the patents covering Epogen. 
Amgen filed suit against Transkaryotic nearly six years ago, claiming that
the firm infringed five Epogen patents.  The Appeals Court and District
Court made several decisions favoring each firm, but both courts concurred
that Transkaryotic was essentially making EPO, which infringed at least
two of Amgen's patents.  If Transkaryotic had not infringed any of Amgen's
patents, the firm would have likely gained a legal basis for making any
approved therapeutic protein.  Fortunately, Amgen's patent position on
Epogen was simply too comprehensive for Transkaryotic to overcome.

What's next for Transkaryotic?  Actually, the firm did win its patent
battle against Amgen in Europe and the firm can sell Dynepo in the
European Union.  Although, there has yet to be an indication when sales
will commence and the European market is not as large as the U.S. market. 
Transkaryotic also will meet with an FDA advisory committee on January
14th to discuss the firm's drug application for Replagal, a treatment for
Fabry disease.  Recent data regarding kidney function was not too
favorable for Transkaryotic, so it's difficult to gauge how the FDA panel
may respond.

GENZYME (GENZ, $32, up 4%) will also be presenting its drug application
for Fabrazyme to the same FDA advisory committee on January 13th.  Both
Replagal and Fabrazyme are the same protein molecule (alpha-galactosidase
A) being used to treat Fabry's.  Here's another situation where
Transkaryotic is using its technology to develop a protein that was
patented by someone else.  Genzyme and Transkaryotic had their court
battle last year and so far the rulings have favored Transkaryotic. 
Nevertheless, with both Replagal and Fabrazyme having received Orphan Drug
designation, there is the potential for one of these drugs to gain a
seven-year marketing exclusivity in the U.S.  Both drugs are currently
sold in the European Union.


GILEAD SELLS $345 MILLION IN CONVERTIBLE NOTES
Shares of GILEAD SCIENCES (GILD, $37, up 4%) have weakened a bit since
management announced the all-cash takeover of TRIANGLE PHARMACEUTICALS
(VIRS, $6, unch.).  We thought the acquisition would be a good fit for
Gilead, but we were concerned about the deal consuming most all of
Gilead's cash position.  Gilead has now successfully raised $345 million
from the sale of convertible notes and the firm expects to have nearly
one-half billion cash following the Triangle acquisition.

At this week's JP Morgan H&Q Healthcare Conference, Gilead management
stated that the firm will present new data on its anti-HIV drug Viread
throughout the year.  In addition, there will be two-year clinical data
released this year regarding the efficacy of Hepsera in the treatment of
hepatitis B.  The firm expects to bring Hepsera to market in the first
half of 2003.

Triangle Pharmaceuticals submitted its Coviracil drug application to the
European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products.  Coviracil
(emtricitabine) is a once-daily nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
for the treatment of HIV infection and is currently under review by the
U.S. FDA.


MERCK'S SINGULAIR JOINS THE FIGHT AGAINST HAY FEVER
In a field already crowded with antihistamines and nasal steroids, MERCK'S
(MRK, $60, up 1%) asthma drug Singulair received FDA approval for the
treatment of seasonal allergies.  Singulair, which has been on the market
for five years, is the first prescription allergy drug that works by
blocking inflammation-causing proteins called leukotrienes.  This
contrasts with traditional drugs that stop inflammation by blocking
histamine.  Such drugs include Allegra and loratadine, which is now
available over-the-counter as Claritin or Alavert.

Recently, Merck projected a 25% increase in 2003 Singulair sales to over
$2 billion.  However, with the drug costing at least twice as much as
existing antihistamines, Singulair's success in the allergy market is not
expected to immediately blossom.  In addition, Singulair is encountering
competition from GLAXOSMITHKLINE'S (GSK, $40, up 3%) asthma drug Advair. 
Merck is scheduled to release earnings at the end of this month and we
expect the firm to provide further guidance on Singulair sales.  With the
allergy season beginning in March, Merck will have to work fast to develop
a competitive allergy advertisement campaign.

Merck's share price has been holding up well in recent weeks and we
believe shares are fairly valued near $58.  But, we will maintain the
position because the stock remains in an upward trend.  Perhaps the recent
news regarding the potential elimination of taxes on dividends is
attracting investors to Merck shares, which currently provide a 2.4%
dividend yield.  On the negative side, there have been recent reports
suggesting that Merck has been using its Medco unit (a drug prescription
benefits manager) to enhance sales of its own drugs, and investigations
into this issue may further delay the Medco spin-off.

            considering the prospects for the Biotech sector in 2003, there
            appears to be little excitement -- and this might be the right
            medicine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In late 2001,
            Biotech stocks were performing well despite weakness in the Nasdaq
            Composite; there was still much investment fervor for the sector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>At that time, six Biotech stocks were added to the <b>Nasdaq-100
            Index (NDX)</b> to replace downtrodden internet dotcoms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The change increased the NDX's Biotech representation to 18
            stocks and a 15% market-cap weighting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Back then, many large-cap Biotechs were still trading above
            $50 per share and the sector appeared poised to keep the NDX from
            falling too hard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
            in early 2002, there were too many disappointments on the drug
            development front and stock prices trickled lower throughout the
            year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, last
            month, six Biotech securities were pulled out of the NDX thereby
            bringing the Biotech representation back to 12.&nbsp;<o:p>

            the investment enthusiasm appears subdued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>In fact, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst downgraded the entire
            Biotech sector to Marketweight from Overweight, claiming a lack of
            upcoming medical meetings and FDA decisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Well, we might not observe a general rise among all Biotech
            stocks this year, as occurred in 1999/2000, but it seems that the
            greatest declines in share prices already have occurred and there
            will be many developments this year to lift specific stocks.&nbsp;<o:p>

            must deliver on its product pipeline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

            </span>Several weeks ago, the company lowered 2002 earnings guidance

            patients.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the

            to gauge investor sentiment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The

            </span>As a guideline, a sector is considered to be overbought or
            oversold when the Bullish Percent moves above 70% or below 30%,
            respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the

            A U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has upheld the
            decision of a lower District Court in ruling that <b>TRANSKARYOTIC
            THERAPIES (TKTX, $9, down 12%) </b>infringed two of AMGEN'S Epogen
            patents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While the
            Appeals Court remanded a couple of rulings back to the District
            Court for a final decision, the infringement judgments should just
            about shut the door on Transkaryotic's attempt to bring Dynepo, an
            anti-anemia drug, to the U.S. market.&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why
            did Transkaryotic's management ever believe that they could
            challenge Amgen's Epogen patents and win the right to market Dynepo?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>After all, Dynepo and Epogen are essentially the same
            erythropoietin (EPO) molecule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The key for Transkaryotic, and the basis for the firm's
            existence, is that its technology uses a novel method for producing
            therapeutic proteins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            strategy involves the direct insertion of genetic elements into a
            cell's DNA to &quot;turn on&quot; a specific gene, thereby making a
            specific protein.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
            process differs from traditional cloning methods for protein
            production where the gene encoding a therapeutic protein is first
            isolated from a cell, genetically modified to improve expression
            (protein production) and then reinserted into a mammalian cell for
            mass production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
            Transkaryotic's methods do not involve gene isolation, or
            traditional cloning schemes, management believes that they have a
            valid basis to produce marketed protein therapeutics previously
            created through gene cloning.&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            problem for Transkaryotic is that the firm is basically using its
            technology to develop protein drugs that are already on the market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Sure, the firm is using a different means to produce its
            drug, but in the end, it is replicating what already exists.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>With Amgen's many patents covering both the process for
            producing Epogen and Epogen itself, it was difficult for
            Transkaryotic to not infringe at least the patents covering Epogen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Amgen filed suit against Transkaryotic nearly six years ago,
            claiming that the firm infringed five Epogen patents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The Appeals Court and District Court made several decisions
            favoring each firm, but both courts concurred that Transkaryotic was
            essentially making EPO, which infringed at least two of Amgen's
            patents.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If Transkaryotic had not infringed any of Amgen's patents,
            the firm would have likely gained a legal basis for making any
            approved therapeutic protein.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately,
            Amgen's patent position on Epogen was simply too comprehensive for
            Transkaryotic to overcome.&nbsp;<o:p>

            next for Transkaryotic?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Actually,
            the firm did win its patent battle against Amgen in Europe and the
            firm can sell Dynepo in the European Union.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Although, there has yet to be an indication when sales will
            commence and the European market is not as large as the U.S. market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Transkaryotic also will meet with an FDA advisory committee
            on January 14th to discuss the firm's drug application for Replagal,
            a treatment for Fabry disease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Recent data regarding kidney function was not too favorable
            for Transkaryotic, so it's difficult to gauge how the FDA panel may
            respond.&nbsp;<o:p>

            </span>Both Replagal and Fabrazyme are the same protein molecule
            (alpha-galactosidase A) being used to treat Fabry's.<span style="mso-spacerun:
