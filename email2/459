Subject: Healthy Heart Market January 2003

Welcome to the January 2003 edition of the Healthy Heart Market newsletter.  This month we get a taste of the soon to be released cookbook, The No-Salt Lowest-Sodium Baking Cookbook.  This book is chocked full of wonderful recipes for breads, treats and everything else you can think of to bake with flour.  Those of you who own Don’s first cookbook know that it is a staple for us low sodium folks.  Those of you who do not own it should visit my web store and order up the set of both books for a special savings.  The baking book is set to be released March 1st of this year.  I am accepting orders now and offering free shipping for all preorders!  Just take a look at the recipes below and you will see this book is going to be a winner.  When you are at the web store placing your order be sure and give the Lum Taylors BBQ Sauce a try.  I added it last month and it is getting rave reviews.  I just received a fresh batch Friday.

Where is all the snow?  My kids are a little upset the sleds have not left the garage yet.  At least the temp finally dropped below zero.  At last, livable weather.  The ya- you betcha’s are flying around the northland now.

I had an echo a couple weeks back.  Results are the same as the last few years.  EF around the low 20’s and heart size the same.  Stable and holding my doc says.  Thanks to all who have been asking for an update.  

Sale items this month are closeouts on some Pritikin Products.  I discounted these a lot.  If you use any of these products this is your last chance to get them from Healthy Heart Market so stock up.

Now on to the recipes.

DON'S BISCUITS
Biscuits proved a challenge to create without salt or regular baking soda/powder.  I had to make one that tasted like the biscuits of old.  But to make one that will satisfy everyone at the table became difficult without real baking soda, real baking powder and of course - salt.  My favorite former life biscuit recipe simply could not be converted. But it's bingo time now.  I've been making these now for a few months and they always come out great.  Make sure you serve them hot out of the oven to 
yourself and to your guests.  I do freeze leftovers and they make great snacks at family picnics or 
during a long drive somewhere.  Leave the butter at home, there's plenty in the biscuit.

Makes 10 -  2 1/2"  biscuits

Sodium Per Recipe: 169.8 mg
Sodium Per Biscuit: 17 mg

2 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour (5 mg)
1 tablespoon Ener-G Baking Soda*  (trace)
1 1/2 teaspoons Featherweight Baking Powder* (3 mg)
1 teaspoon sugar or honey or Splenda sugar substitute  (.042 mg)
6 tablespoons unsalted butter (6.248 mg)
1 egg white, beaten (54.8 mg)
3/4 reduced fat - reduced sodium cultured buttermilk (See below for brand in your area) or cup nonfat milk! (94.6 mg)

Preheat oven to 350o F.

Beat egg white until white and nearly stiff.

Toss together the flour, Ener-G baking soda, Featherweight  baking powder, sugar.  Bring in the butter, sliced thinly and at room temperature.  Mix with wood spoon or hands until slightly crumbly.  Bring in buttermilk and stir with spoon until well mixed.  Bring in beaten egg and stir.

Set out on lightly floured breadboard and knead with your hands for about a minute a minute or two.  Make sure you get all the flour mix in the bowl into the mix.  Flatten with your hands, roll over and flatten again, then roll that over and flatten it again to about 3/4".  Cut with biscuit cutter or drinking glass with about a 2 to 2 1/2" opening into 8 - 10  biscuits.  You may also shape with your hands - a style that gives them that old country-farm look.  These are not "drop" biscuits, so what you shape is what you get - expanded a bit.  Place on lightly greased baking sheets.

Bake at 350o F for about 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve hot out of the oven.

This unusual recipe can also be baked at 450o F for 12 to 14 minutes.  However, the hotter the oven the less the biscuits will rise.

Enjoy!

! The buttermilk helps make these flakier.  Nonfat milk tends to make them crispier or a bit more "solid."

Buttermilk, Reduced Fat, Cultured, Reduced Sodium
The following brands supply buttermilk with 130 mg to 150 mg per cup or less.  Standard buttermilks range from 260 mg to 290 mg per cup.  These can generally be found in your local supermarket.  The USDA lists a buttermilk with only 6 mg of sodium, but we've never found it.  Reconstituted buttermilk doesn’t work as well in this recipe.
