                  Novartis Grabs Rights To New Drug Designed To Improve =
Nearsightedness
                  Novartis (NVS) has obtained exclusive rights to =
develop and market a pharmaceutical treatment for myopia =
(nearsightedness) from Valley Forge Pharmaceuticals. The drug, =
pirenzepine, is currently in Phase II trials, where it has been shown to =
reduce the progression of myopia by at least 50% in the first 12 months =
of therapy.

Q4 2002 earnings on Thursday, January 30 at 10 a.m. ET. www.bausch.com

                  National Vision (NVI) reported overall domestic =
comparable store sales increased 4.5% in Q4 2002. The Wal-Mart division =
delivered a comparable store sales increase of 2.5%. Sales growth for =
the year resulted from growth in eyeglass units, contact lens units and =
average eyeglass transaction values. The company also announced that =
Reade Fahs, its president and COO, has been appointed president and CEO.
                  Oakley (OO) reaffirmed its Q4 2002 sales guidance of =
approximately $100 million, representing an 11% increase from Q4 2001. =
The company also reaffirmed guidance for Q4 earnings of $0.03 per =
diluted share before a previously announced European restructuring =
charge or breakeven to $0.01 after the charge. Net sales growth for 2003 =
is expected to be driven by a 30% to 35% increase in sales of the =
company's newer product categories (which include prescription eyewear), =
an 85% to 90% increase in sales from retail operation and a slight =
increase in sales of sunglasses. The company expects gross margins for =
2003 to decline about 100 basis points below 2002 levels. Operating =
expenses are expected to increase 17% to 19%. Interest expenses for 2003 =
are expected to be about $2 million. The company expects to generate =
between $15 million and $18 million of free cash flow.

                  ISTA Pharmaceuticals (ISTA) says the FDA has accepted =
Senju Pharmaceutical's New Drug Application for its formulation of =
timolol for treating glaucoma, called ISTALOL. ISTA holds the marketing =
rights to the product in the U.S. Clinical trials of this formulation =
have shown comparable efficacy and safety to timolol maleate ophthalmic =
solution, which the company says is the leading beta blocker.

                  Inspire Pharmaceuticals (ISPH) plans to submit by mid =
year an FDA New Drug Application for diquafosol (INS365 ophthalmic) for =
treating dry eye. The filing will be based on safety and efficacy data =
from the completed Phase II and III trials. This solution demonstrated =
statistically significant improvements in those studies. The company has =
a licensing, development and marketing agreement with Allergan (AGN) for =
both diquafosol and Allergan's Restasis. Inspire reported that =
Allergan's recent FDA approval of Restasis will have no impact on the =
company's 2003 revenues, which is estimated to total $5 million to $6 =
million.

                  Scott Tanner, COO and CFO of 1-800 Contacts (CTAC), is =
leaving the company to pursue other career possibilities and personal =
interests. CEO Jonathan Coon will temporarily assume the title of =
interim CFO while the company searches for a replacement for Tanner. The =
company named Graham Mullis president of its international operations. =
In other news, the Pacific Exchange announced it has begun trading on =
1-800 Contacts under the symbol QCJ. The options will trade on the March =
expiration cycle with limits set at 13,500 contracts. Lead Market Makers =
Ross Goodheart and Lee Gordon of Group One Trading will trade the issue.

                  SurgiLight (SRGL.OB) reported that all 10 patients =
treated with its OptiVision system at two U.S. clinical trial sites =
demonstrated the ability to read a newspaper without the aid of =
corrective lenses. Six of the 10 showed optimal overall eyesight at =
varying distances. The company also reported that the same procedure had =
demonstrated significant clinical success with more than eight of every =
10 patients in several trials held overseas. Pending further FDA =
clearance, the company plans more trials in the U.S. In other news, =
SurgiLight plans to defend itself in a lawsuit by Merrill Lynch. Merrill =
Lynch declared a previously granted $500,000 credit amount in default. =
SurgiLight also reported that the terms of a $10 million credit line =
issued by another source had been finalized and that a private placement =
agreement for $450,000, which is expected to be completed later this =
month, has been signed with a group of accredited investors. Those =
investors will purchase one share of SurgiLight restricted common stock =
for $0.29 each and obtain a warrant with an exercise price of $0.42 per =
share.

                  Addition Technology reported that Q4 2002 sales of =
Intacs increased nearly 87% over the prior year. In addition to growth =
in the U.S., the company's international business grew more than 30%, =
which was driven by therapeutic uses of the product in Europe. Clinical =
trials of Intacs for keratoconus have been completed in Europe, where =
studies are now underway to evaluate Intacs for treating hyperopia =
(farsightedness) and myopia (nearsightedness) with greater than 1.00 =
diopter of astigmatism.

                  Drugstore.com (DSCM) and AC Lens announced a =
three-year partnership that will allow customers of the Internet =
drugstore to purchase contact lenses. Customers will be able to order =
through drugstore.com, and AC Lens will handle verification and =
fulfillment. The companies say major contact lens manufacturers will be =
represented, and that they plan to launch the drugstore.com Eyewear =
Store early this year.
