        FDA APPROVES HUMIRA FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the drug
Humira, made by Abbott Labs, to treat moderate to severe
rheumatoid arthritis. Humira is the first human monoclonal
antibody approved for reducing symptoms and inhibiting the
progression of structural damage in adults with RA who have
not done well with other treatments. Humira is given every
other week through an injection and a specially designed
pre-filled syringe for RA patients whose hands might be
affected by crippling joint destruction will be available
in pharmacies next month. The FDA approved the drug after
reviewing the results of clinical trials on more than 2,000
RA patients. Some patients saw an improvement in RA signs
and symptoms as early as one week after taking the drug.
Humira can be prescribed alone or with other RA medications.
It resembles antibodies normally found in the body and works
by blocking tumor necrosis factor alpha, a protein that
plays a central role in the inflammatory responses of auto-
immune diseases such as RA.

            PROTECTION ORDERS WORK FOR WOMEN

Civil protection orders are effective at protecting women
from injuries inflicted by an abusive partner, a new study
indicates. "Based on these findings, civil protection
orders appear to be one of the few widely available inter-
ventions for victims of intimate partner violence that has
demonstrated effectiveness," says study author Victoria
Holt of the Department of Epidemiology at the University
of Washington in Seattle. The problem is only 20 percent
of the approximately 2 million U.S. women who are physical-
ly abused, stalked or raped by partners each year obtain
such orders, the study shows. The researchers say inter-
views of abused women show those who obtained and maintain-
ed a civil protection order were safer than those without
them in the five-month period after they were initially
threatened or abused. When Holt and colleagues interviewed
the women again four months later, they found the protec-
tion order effect had grown even stronger.

            COUNSELING HELPS HIGH RISK PATIENTS

A Department of Health and Human Services task force says
extended behavioral counseling can help patients who are at
high risk for heart disease and other chronic illnesses.
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force noted, however,
there is not enough evidence to gauge the effectiveness of
brief, routine counseling among healthy adults. The task
force reviewed 35 years of diet counseling studies and con-
cluded intensive counseling by primary care physicians or
dietary specialists can help at-risk adult patients eat
less fat and more fruits and vegetables. Effective counsel-
ing typically involved multiple individual or group sessions
and stressed techniques to boost patients' skills, motiva-
tion, social supports and personal involvement in setting
goals. The task force cited a lack of controlled studies of
routine diet counseling in children and teens and a lack of
good information on the possible harms of diet counseling
as reasons for not recommending routine counseling for
those age groups.
