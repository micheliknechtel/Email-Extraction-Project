			December Comet was all wrapped up and ready to put under the Christmas tree when we ran into - umm 'technical difficulties' is how our corporate-speak dictionary describes it. You don't want to know. Anyway, after a month of the traditional Aussie summer shutdown, we're back! You might notice a new look, as Comet is now being delivered in HTML. Our giant new competition, with airfares as prizes, might offset any probems you have with HTML. (Actually, there shouldn't be any problems. We've tried to keep the size to a minimum, without losing your favourite Comet features, and if it doesn't seem to be appearing as it should, check that your email is set to receive HTML emails.)

			<span class="hed1"><a name="spot"></a>IN THE SPOTLIGHT<br><br> 
           Vanuatu's Kava Culture</span> 
			
			<p class="text">
			If you're visiting Vanuatu (a South Pacific island nation) you may find the nightlife a little lacklustre, that is, until you discover kava... Lonely Planet author Michelle Bennett investigates:
			</p>
			
<p class="text">Variously known as sakau, yaqona or `ava throughout the Pacific, kava is the drink of choice in Vanuatu. Many people wouldn't consider a day complete without throwing back a couple of 'shells' of the stuff. Traditionally and more formally though, a kava ceremony is held to welcome visitors, seal alliances, start chiefly conferences and to commemorate births, deaths and marriages.</p>
              <p class="text">For such special occasions, there are strict rules 
                for preparing and drinking kava, and preparation procedures vary 
                throughout Vanuatu's 83 islands. On parts of Tanna, for example, 
                kava roots are brought to the nakamal (men's clubhouse) each afternoon 
                by pre-pubescent boys. The boys prepare the roots by chewing them 
                into a mush, which is then mixed with water and filtered through 
                coconut fibres. (Don't let the chewing bit turn you off - in many 
                places these days the roots are simply ground up, no spit involved...)</p>
<p class="text">This liquid mixture is then poured into a half-coconut shell, which serves as a cup (hence, the term 'shell' for a draught of kava). First the chief drinks it, followed by any honoured guests, then other men drink in order of precedence. Etiquette requires drinking each shell in a single gulp; any remaining liquid is poured on the ground. It's also generally drunk in a quiet atmosphere: conversation and loud noises are kept to a minimum.</p>
<p class="text">While many people visiting Vanuatu won't have the honour of witnessing or participating in a traditional kava ceremony, the fact that it's also consumed regularly as a social drink means that the opportunity to try some is never too far away.</p>
<p class="text">You'll find that kava has a pungent, muddy and slightly peppery taste - it looks like very dirty dishwater, and many would say it doesn't taste much better. But it's not that bad, in fact given a chance it definitely grows on you. If the brew is a strong one - and there's a good chance it will be as Vanuatu's kava is reputedly the strongest in the world - your lips will go numb and cold almost instantly (even my throat went numb!). Then after about 20 minutes your limbs will feel heavy, your speech will become quiet and slow and your eyes will be sensitive to any glare (kava bars are very dimly lit because of this). Even if it's only a mild brew, you'll probably want to do nothing more than lie down and think about life, feeling sedated and happy.</p>
<p class="text">On many of the more remote, tradition-oriented islands of Vanuatu, kava drinking is an exclusively male activity surrounded by all sorts of tabu (taboos). However, in other areas, especially in the capital Port Vila, where there are over 100 kava bars, most being little more than iron sheds, women are generally more than welcome to join in.</p>
              <p class="text">In addition to its ceremonial and social uses, some 
                of the 40 sub-species of kava (known botanically as Piper methysticum), 
                are used locally as bush medicine, as they contain natural pain 
                and appetite-suppressants as well as antibacterial, relaxant, 
                diuretic and decongestant properties. Over the past decade, kava-based 
                food supplements and herbal medicines also gained popularity in 
                Europe, Australia and the USA for alleviating stress, anxiety 
                and insomnia. For a while there it was an increasingly lucrative 
                export market for Vanuatu, and its Pacific pals Fiji, Samoa and 
                Tonga.</p>
<p class="text">In November 2001, however, the latest 'wonder drug' received bad press when the European Union announced that consumption of kava could be linked to liver damage. So far, the evidence is inconclusive. It may be that kava manufactured into capsules is the problem, rather than kava drunk as a liquid (the active ingredient in kava, kavalactone, is much more concentrated in pill form). Your average Ni-Vanuatu may be testament to this theory: they certainly don't look any the worse for wear, even those who have drunk the stuff daily for years. For visitors to the Pacific who haven't been imbibing kava for centuries though, it may be a case of everything in moderation.</p>

<p class="text">We've given this month's Compass competition a slightly different slant. For a chance to win one of 20 Lonely Planet guidebooks (we'll be sending winners a voucher), we'd like you to tell us what country you would be in if you asked the question "ta-pai-ko bi-hah bha-yo?" (that's a transliteration of the script), and what would you be asking? Small hint - the language isn't Hindi but it's a close relation.</p>

              <p class="text">We're continuing with an added bonus for ekno members. Send your entry to us via your ekno email address and if you're lucky enough to be one of the 20 book winners your luck might hold and you might be one of the four people who win a US$20 account top-up. What on earth is ekno, you might ask? Find out more at:<a href="http://www.ekno.lonelyplanet.com" target="_blank">

			Persia, called Iran since 1934, has long fascinated and daunted travellers. From the outside it inspires images of the exotic and mysterious, but also an element of danger. The latter is a slightly misguided perception. Put aside media images of fervent anti-Western marches and secret police - Iran is a remarkably safe, stable and hospitable country to visit.
			</p>
			
<p class="text">Having recovered from the excesses of the Islamic Revolution, and the aftermath of the Iran-Iraq War, Iran is one of the most fascinating, welcoming and inexpensive countries in the Middle East, and many parts of it are yet to be 'discovered' by travellers. Although getting a visa is no formality, the doors are certainly open, tourism is gradually being developed, and most foreigners - including Americans - are treated warmly and with great interest by the Iranian people.</p>
<p class="text">The main attractions are history and culture: days can be spent exploring age-old bazaars, chatting over tea in traditional teahouses, shopping for carpets, visiting enormous blue-tiled mosques, shrines and ruins of ancient cities, and simply meeting ordinary Iranians. There is also some good trekking and skiing in the northern mountains.
</p>
<p class="text">What you choose to see in Iran, and in what order, will depend on how you're travelling. Iran is one of the largest countries in the Middle East but transport is excellent and cheap enough to allow you to combine flying with bus and train travel. For overland travellers there's a fairly standard route that crosses the country from northwest to southeast. Assuming you're coming from Turkey your first stop will be Tabriz, a city with a Turkish influence and Iran's oldest bazaar. From there, travel across to the Caspian Sea coast and spend a night or two in the beautiful hill village of Masuleh, where you can go hiking in the surrounding forest. Alternatively, head for the romantic Castles of the Assassins near Qazvin, another good area for hiking. The capital, Tehran, is for many travellers merely a transport hub, but it's worth a couple of days to explore its museums or as a base for trips to the Alborz Mountains.</p>
<p class="text">From Tehran, journey by train to Esfahan, the undisputed highlight of Iran with its stunning blue-tiled architecture and teahouses built into the pillars of bridges. After a few days in Esfahan (with a possible side trip to Kashan and the historic village of Abyaneh), continue on to Shiraz and spend a day exploring the ancient ruins of Persepolis. From there, cut across to Yazd, with its remarkable old city, then make the long desert crossing to Bam, an oasis town with a superb mud-walled citadel. If you have more time, you could break the journey at Kerman.</p>
<p class="text">If you're not travelling overland and fly into Tehran, you could cover the Tehran-Bam part of this route, then fly back to Tehran from Kerman. Since flying is cheap in Iran, you could easily add a trip to Mashhad to visit the Holy Shrine of Emam Reza or (in winter) fly down to Kish Island in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p class="text">While Iran is still a religiously conservative country and the pace of political reform is slow, few travellers leave without a sense of wonder and respect for the people and places of modern-day Persia.</p>

			<p class="text">This issue of Comet was put together as Muslims filled-up the empty spaces left by the Ramadan fast, as Jews finished the last of the Hannukah treats, and as Christians began the run-up to Christmas feasting. Entering the spirit of monotheistic surfeit, Comet is rewarding not one, not two but three readers for their Top 5s this month! And there's even a stocking-stuffer of two very useful travel tips at the end. (We realise that those festivals are now just distant memories, but we'll buck the trend of selling Eatser Eggs in January, and look back rather than forward. Comet makes its own rules!)</p> 
			  <p class="text"><b>From Mike Post</b></p> 
			<p class="text">On endless journeys by bus/train/boat/plane, or when being imprisoned in solitary confinement and your mind's too pulpy to read or talk, take your time and try to remember the following:</p>
			<p class="text">
1. year and circumstances of your first kiss<br>

2. year and circumstances of your first booze<br>

3. year and circumstances of your first journey<br>

4. year and circumstances of your first love; then<br>

5. list all next-times of the above.<br></p>

			  <p class="text"><b>From Nikki Hudson</b></p> 
			<p class="text">There is nothing more useful when backpacking than the basic essentials; penknife, torch etc, but I always carry a plastic mug - why, you ask? Well below are my top 5 reasons why but there are stacks of uses for this small and multipurpose piece of equipment.</p>

<p class="text">1. The obvious - drink out of it - easier than drinking with your hands or out of the bottle.</p> 

<p class="text">2. Clean your teeth in it - not literally - but using a small amount of water to wash your brush in. Whilst travelling you always feel 100% better with sparklingly clean teeth. It also saves water, since you're not tipping this precious commodity over your brush and feet.</p> 

<p class="text">3. Put your watch, lipsalve, penknife, small torch etc in it when you go to sleep - this way they're really easy to find in the morning and you're not messing about searching under your sleeping bag.</p> 

<p class="text">4. You can use it to trap creepy crawlies under when they have ventured into your tent, or trap and transport back outside those sneaky earwigs.</p> 

<p class="text">5. Transport home those little breakable items that you inevitably collect. It's solid and so with the fragiles packed in and stood upright in the side pocket of your backpack they're sure to get home in one piece. For added security you could put the mug in a sock and surround the whole thing with more socks!</p> 
			

			  <p class="text"><b>From Vicki M</b></p> 
			<p class="text">Top 5 ways to get a leave of absence from work in order to travel.</p>

<p class="text">1. Show the boss how much money will be saved by not paying you while you're away.</p> 

<p class="text">2. Point out that all the other people in your department have taken 
maternity leave (one year in Canada), while you're only asking for a measly 
few months....
</p> 

<p class="text">3. Catch your boss in an appropriate mood, ie, when they're wistfully 
thinking about tacking a vacation on to that conference they're attending 
next year.
</p> 

<p class="text">4. Do ALL the mountains of paperwork yourself so in the end, all they have 
to do is sign on the dotted line.
</p> 

<p class="text">5.  Promise to never never never tell anyone else you work with what you're 
doing so that they won't ask for the same thing...

 <p class="text"><b>From Todd Lang</b></p> 
			<p class="text">There is no better way to use dryer lint than to use it as a fire starter when camping. It's cheap, light, and lights easily with a match. Maybe other readers have better ways to use dryer lint, but this is the only one I have. I could not even come up with a top five for it!</p>
			
<p class="text"><b>From Janet Domas</b></p> 
			<p class="text">My travel hot tip is DENTAL FLOSS</p>
						
<p class="text">It's light-weight, durable and you wouldn't leave home without it. I first discovered its versatility when I purchased a black pearl pendant in Bora Bora. I was anxious to wear my new beauty but had not packed a necklace, so I strung it on dental floss and wore it proudly.</p>
<p class="text">I have also used it as an early alert system by tying a chair to a door knob after seeing suspicious characters wander the halls of the place I was staying.</p>
<p class="text">It works for hanging a flashlight in your tent, and in a pinch as a shoelace.</p>

<p class="text"><b>From Tamsin Ranger, travel addict</b> (affectionately referred to on the road as Lone Ranger)</p>

<p class="text">When I was new to the travelling world, I experienced many a safety wake-up call whilst travelling carefree (or should I say carelessly?) through Thailand. An incident I still remember with rosy cheeks is my quest for a brand-name track top. Whilst scouting Khao San Road, I came across a rack of fake adidas clothing, unable to find what I wanted the stall owner promised to return the following day.</p>
<p class="text">The next morning I found the stall owner, but he could not bring his wares down Khao San in his truck as the road was too busy, he did however offer to take us to his store 'room'. I gladly followed, determined to get my label wear. We followed the small Thai man down a dirty, narrow and 'pungent' alley and turned into a door. The door we were entering was in fact a dark, seedy looking pool bar called "the hole in the wall" (how fitting). We were lead through the bar, where several large men regarded us suspiciously, and onto to a rickety spiral staircase.</p>
<p class="text">At this point reality kicked in, in the form of my travel companion. She tugged my sleeve and mentioned that perhaps going up a winding staircase into who knows what with a scary looking Thai man might not be the wisest thing we could do. I asked the man if he could bring the wares downstairs but he insisted we had to go up with him. Reluctantly we followed, shoving our passports into our knickers, convinced we were about to re-enact a scene from Brokedown Palace, and that this would be a story parents warned their travelling children about.</p>
<p class="text">Upon reaching the top of the stairs, our guide opened a door into a small room. There were three mattresses strewn across the floor and three Thai men stood around drinking coffee and regarding us lasciviously. I knew then and there that we were about to be sold to the white sex trade and would never again see the light of day.Then and there, our guide invited us in and showed us the racks of fake clothing stored in the corner and his friends promptly offered us cups of tea and a free Farang magazine. Visions of leaving intact and safe (with my track top) flooded my brain and after a chat with the surprisingly friendly gentlemen we left unscathed, although rather shaken.</p>
<p class="text">Tip: No need to be paranoid, but before following a seemingly friendly Thai man down alleys (or in fact anywhere) ask yourself whether the situation has the potential to turn into an urban legend to be discussed on the Thorn Tree!!</p>

<p class="text">***</p>
