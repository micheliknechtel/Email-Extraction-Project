TAX-FREE INTERNET BILL HEADS TO CONGRESS

A bill to continue the ban on Internet taxes was among the 
first facing the new 108th Congress when the new session 
started Tuesday, Internet.com reports. Sponsored by Sen. Ron 
Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., the bill 
prohibits three types of taxes they said unfairly singles out 
the Internet for taxation, including taxes on Internet access,
double taxation -- such as taxes levied by two or more 
states -- for goods or services purchased over the Internet, 
and discriminatory taxes that treat Internet sales differently 
from other types of purchases. The bill is an extension of the 
Internet Tax Freedom Act that Wyden and Cox introduced in 
1998, which was a three-year moratorium that was extended for 
another two years in 2001 by additional legislation the two 
congressmen sponsored. As in the past, the new bill proposes
a permanent ban on Internet taxes. However, Internet.com said, 
it is more likely Congress will settle on another extension 
on the act, with cash-strapped states looking for to the tax 
revenue the Internet could generate.


FTC LAUNCHES SITE AGAINST CROSS-BORDER FRAUD

The Federal Trade Commission Wednesday said it is launching 
a new Web site to battle the multi-billion dollar problem of 
cross-border fraud. Each year, the FTC reports, consumers 
from the United States and abroad lose billions of dollars a 
year to telemarketers pitch bogus products, services and 
investments from "boiler rooms" across the border. The new 
site, ftc.gov/crossborder, features information the FTC said 
is designed to help consumers spot, stop and avoid 
cross-border fraud, with information on recent FTC law 
enforcement actions against cross-border scam artists and the 
commission's coordination with law enforcement agencies 
abroad. Also featured are downloadable consumer education 
publications, such as "Hang Up on Cross-Border Phone Fraud," 
"Border-Line Scams are the Real Thing," and "Straight Talk 
About Telemarketing."

ONLINE CRITICS TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS

A Kansas home-security company that had filed a request in a 
Dalla County court to discover the identity of online critics 
has backed away from the action, non-profit consumer advocacy 
organization Public Citizen reported. The Washington, D.C., 
non-profit said Protection One had sought the identities of 
11 Internet users who had posted criticisms of the company 
anonymously on a Yahoo! message board, without providing 
evidence that the statements were false or actionable or 
explaining why a Texas court should have jurisdiction over 
the case. Public Citizen reports Protection One dropped the 
request after finding out the non-profit was to defend one of 
the critics. "Courts recognize that online speakers have a 
vital First Amendment right to anonymous speech unless there 
is a good reason to believe the speech is harmful, and it is 
highly unlikely that the court would have infringed on that 
right based on Protection One's weak arguments," said Paul 
Alan Levy, a Public Citizen attorney representing one of the 
anonymous users. "Corporations need to learn that they cannot 
expect to identify their online critics simply for the price 
of filing a complaint. The can enforce subpoenas only if they 
are prepared to go forward with a libel suit," Levy said. 
Protection One had not commented about the action on its Web 
site.

CONSUMERS TURN TO NET FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE

In the next months American consumers will look to the 
Internet more than the phone for customer service inquiries 
if trends follow the pattern set last year, research and 
consultancy comany The Dieringer Research Group reports. 
According to Dieringer's annual Anerican Interactive Consumer 
Survey, in the first quarter of 2002 64.3 million Americans 
phoned call centers vs. 40.5 million who went online for 
advise and support. However, despite these numbers, online 
users averaged 10.5 inquiries per customer compared to only 
4.4 per user for telephone-based inquriries. Among the forms 
of online support, e-mail was most popular, getting greater 
reports of satisfaction compared to instant messaging. 
However, consumers who like using IM technology are likely 
to use it more frequently than other forms of customer
support. "Consumers told us that when they're really upset 
about something, the phone works better, but when they've 
just got a general inquiry, the Internet works better," said 
Thomas E. Miller, a senior consultant at Dieringer.
