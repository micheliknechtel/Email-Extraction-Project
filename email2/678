On this date in history: 
  
In 1610, Galileo, using his primitive telescope, discovered 
the four major moons of Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede and 
Callisto.
  
In 1789, the first nationwide U.S. presidential election was 
held. The electors chosen by the voters unanimously picked 
George Washington as president and John Adams as vice 
president.
  
In 1927, commercial trans-Atlantic telephone service between 
New York and London was inaugurated. 
  
In 1931, as the Great Depression was getting under way, a 
report to President Hoover estimated that four-million to 
five-million Americans were out of work.
  
In 1979, the Cambodian government of Pol Pot was overthrown. 
  
In 1989, Japan's Emperor Hirohito died. 
  
In 1990, Jeffrey Lundgren, a self-proclaimed prophet and 
leader of a breakaway religious sect wanted for the slayings 
of five Ohio followers, was arrested in California at a motel 
near the Mexican border.
  
In 1991, Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney announced he 
was canceling the Navy's A-12 Stealth attack plane project. 
  
And in 1991, loyalist troops attacked Haiti's presidential 
palace, rescuing President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot and captur-
ing the coup plotters.
  
In 1993, the EPA released a long-awaited report that classi-
fied environmental tobacco smoke as a carcinogen. 
  
In 1996, an immense storm system dumped up to three feet of 
snow onto the Mid-Atlantic and New England states. 
  
In 1997, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., was re-elected Speaker 
of the House and then reprimanded for violating House rules 
and misled the House Ethics Committee in its probe of 
possible political use of tax-exempt donations.
  
In 1998, at a time when her association with President 
Clinton was not yet public, former White House intern 
Monica Lewinsky reportedly denied in an affidavit filed 
in the Paula Jones case that she had had an affair with 
him.
  
Also in 1998, a federal jury in Denver was unable to agree 
on a penalty for Terry Nichols, convicted in December 1997 
in connection with the April 1995 bombing of the federal 
building in Oklahoma City. That meant he would not face the 
death penalty.
  
In 1999, President Clinton's impeachment trial opened in the 
Senate. He would be acquitted.
