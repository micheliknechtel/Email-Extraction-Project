So often we forget that there are worlds, as yet
unknown, to conquer. As we look back on the
anniversary of Lewis and Clark, we marvel at the
spirit of adventure that compelled them to explore the
unknown. We are lulled into thinking that contemporary
explorers are safe, that they don't risk their lives
to know the great beyond.

I know that, deep within, so many of us share that
brave spirit to venture out.  We long to know the
secrets of the universe. The spirit hungers within,
ungratified, with a deep longing for adventure and
to find the key to unlock the path to worlds yet
unknown.

Living and working only blocks from the Johnson Space
Center, I spent several years working in the space
program before becoming an entrepreneur.  Two of my
college classmates are active astronauts, as are several
other friends. Our community has reacted with a
combination of shock over the events of the weekend,
along with determination to learn from those events and
move ahead to the future with bold resolve.

The Columbia Seven lit the world with their passion.  As
the stars of the heavens reflect in their eyes, may the
brilliance of its light fill your heart.

******  The Tennis Warrior - Exclusive to Tennis Server INTERACTIVE

The Tennis Warrior is brought to you by Tom Veneziano
(tom@tennisserver.com).  Tom is a tennis pro teaching
at the Piney Point Racquet Club in Houston, Texas.  Tom
has taught thousands of players to think like a pro with
his Tennis Warrior System ( http://www.tenniswarrior.com/ ).

                    Pusher Power!

How do you play a pusher (a player that hits a lot of balls
back, usually with no pace) when you are not as consistent?
Playing a pusher can be frustrating, but you should know
that the pusher wins often because he or she is playing
tennis with the correct principles.  Consistency wins! Even
if you hit a lot of winners, you must be consistent.

Since you are not as consistent as the pusher you will have
to change your tactics and explore other options.  Below are
a couple of different options you can explore.

1. Try to be a little bit more patient when rallying from
    the baseline.  Do not go for too much too soon!

2. Wait for the first relatively short ball and head for
    the net.  Not just once, but over and over and over and
    over and over again. Be relentless! Explore different
    placements with your approach shot - to their forehand,
    to their backhand, down the middle, etc.  Pushers do not
    hit hard so if you can create enough pressure you will
    have many opportunities at the net.  If you can also
    serve and volley, give that a try.

3. You can not volley well?  Then stay on the baseline, hit
    some short balls, and bring the pusher up to the net.
    See how well he or she can volley and hit overheads.

4. The key is to not just stay back and rally with a pusher.
    You must break it up and keep pressure on them by exploring
    different options.  Of course, this may require you to take
    more chances and fail more often, but you have been reading
    the excellent instruction articles from TennisServer.com for
    months and you are prepared!

5. In short, you must take control and attempt to dictate the
    terms to the pusher. You may even have to rally a little bit,
    pick a short ball, and go for a winner.  If you do not
    dictate the terms you will just rally back and forth, get
    some exercise, and lose.

6. Become a pusher yourself.  At least the consistent part of
    their game! Adding a little patience to ones game will do
    wonders for anyone.

Will you still lose with some of these tactics?  Maybe, maybe
not, but at least you gave yourself the best opportunity to
succeed under the conditions.  A true Tennis Warrior mentality!
What you learn from the experience will be useful the next time
you play that same type of player.

Mental Toughness is the accumulation of valuable information to
be utilized at the proper time. To beat a pusher you must
constantly accumulate enough on-court knowledge to play them
intelligently and offset their strength (a never ending flow of
balls coming at you).

In Tom Veneziano's book "The Truth about Winning!", tennis players
learn in a step-by-step fashion the thinking the pros have
mastered to win! Tom takes you Step-by-step from basic mental
toughness to advanced mental toughness. All skill levels can learn
from this unique book from beginner to professional. No need to
change your strokes just your thinking:

***********  This Month's Tennis Server Columns

----------  Between the Lines by Ray Bowers


For 14 days and nights they battled it out in Melbourne.
The match between Roddick and El Aynaoui took up much of
the fortnight, but the other players managed to squeeze in
a few sets as well.  It was a great tournament, and Ray
Bowers reviews the action:

----------  Tennis SET by Jani Macari Pallis, Ph.D.

This month Jani delivers part 3 of her 3-part series on tennis
footwear, discussing foot conditions and injuries, addressing
specific questions Tennis Server readers have submitted, and
noting some interesting athletic shoe Web sites. See:

      Footwear - Part III

----------  WILD CARDS Guest Column of the Month

The month Tony Severino returns, along with Aunt Hazel,
after getting blown off the court by a couple of hackers.
Not just hackers, but rude hackers at that.  How could they
possibly have lost to THEM? Read about what you can do if
you find yourself in a similar situation:

      It Takes Practice by Tony Severino
      http://www.tennisserver.com/wildcards/

Our WILD CARDS column showcases guest writers on the
Tennis Server web site. If you have an interest in
submitting a WILD CARDS column, please contact me
(Cliff Kurtzman) at info@tennisserver.com. 

Parag Khanna wrote us regarding the huge response from
his Wild Cards column we published in January:

"I wanted to let you know how many letters I've been getting
  from all over the world in response to my "Glass Screening"
  column. Overwhelmingly, people agree that the bias is unfair,
  but also remind that it is only in the US where this happens.
  Perhaps a positive consequence in the US has been that there
  are simply far better female tennis players in the US than
  in other countries, hence more reason to cover it. This
  doesn't discount from my qualitative comparison with the men's
  game overall, but does show what a powerful force television
  coverage is in impacting how the game is played and by whom.

  Thanks again for publishing it."
