Fellow Screen and Tube Nuts,

Today is Wednesday and you all know what that means... only
5 more days till the next episode of "Joe Millionaire". Did
you guys see that? I wasn't sure if it was going to be super
cheesy or asinine, but I was captivated the entire time. I 
had to pee so bad but I couldn't leave for fear of missing a
potential cat fight.

The hardest part of watching it, for me, was remembering who
each of the girls were. I was trying to pick who I thought 
was going to win Joe's heart from the beginning, but I found
that task to be extremely difficult. Thankfully, FOX was kind
enough to axe 8 girls and make it easier for us to decipher
between the remaining dozen. 

And how about when Joe bit it when trying to get back on the
horse. And that one chick had the nerve to say he was smooth.
He had about as much suaveness as a pile of broken glass. 
It was exciting to see him almost blow his cover when he 
couldn't think of his middle name... how awesome. 

If you didn't get to see it on Monday, I strongly recommend
checking it out next Monday at 9 pm ET. Watch as these gold-
digging young ladies grovel over this handsome phony who 
actually makes less money than me... and that's scary.

As an added treat for all of you movie buffs out there, I'm 
giving you the opportunity to write your own movie review
and have it appear in the newsletter and on the website. You
can take any movie you want and write up your two cents on
it. More than one entry is perfectly acceptable. I'll be
posting these on Monday, so be sure to send them my way in 
the next couple days. Be sure to include your name (whatever
name you want to appear for all to see) and where you're 
from with the review. And if your review doesn't make it on
here, don't be discouraged. We'll do this again soon.

Be sure to vote for which 'Friends' character you want to 
see naked in the future movie at:

An Arizona judge has temporarily prevented a video tape from
being released by police officers in the drunk-drving arrest
of Diana Ross. Ross was so drunk that she completely flunked
the sobriety test. She was seen on tape giggling and portraying
behavior that wouldn't be too complimentary to the singer. Be
patient, I'll bet the tape surfaces in due time...

Anna Kournikova slipped away from a subpoena by flying to
Australia to play in the Australian Open. Kournikova was 
supposed to testify in a criminal misdemeanor battery
charge in a case that stemmed from an incident last summer
in Miami involving her bodyguard and reporters. The bodyguard
was accompanying Kourinikova and boyfriend Enrique Iglesias...
