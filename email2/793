Greetings,

Well I'm pleased to announce that an old favorite offer of
mine is once again accepting participants. I have the details
below... but let me tell you if it sounds interesting, sign
up fast, because they limit the amount of participants. The
last time they let new people join was about 4 months ago.

Also we have a new offer from Kathryn, one of our readers.

Best,
Becky
