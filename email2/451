EDITOR'S PICK
 
Sopranos, The: The Complete Third Season
 Rating: 4.50 out of 5.00
 There are a lot of people who think that the 
 third season of The Sopranos isn't as good as the 
 previous two. But the fact is it's better - 
 more character driven and deeper than the first 
 two years - it just takes it time slowly building 
 up to the climax, unlike previous seasons, which 
 seemed to have several major climaxes as the episodes 
 progressed.

My Boyfriend's Back
 Rating: 3.50 out of 5.00
 Teenager Johnny Dingle will do anything to keep his 
 date with the hottest girl in school - even come back 
 from the grave! You see, Johnny had the perfect scheme 
 to win the heart of Missy McCloud, the town beauty. 
 Unfortunately, Johnny's scam goes sour and he winds 
 up dead! Even so, Johnny's determined to keep his date - 
 unaware of the hilarity waiting for him upon his return! 
 See for yourself why everyone's dying to see this 
 outlandishly funny comedy!
