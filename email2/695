Dear Perverts, 

Like I promised you urchins last week, today I am going to 
go over my guaranteed strategy for giving a woman an orgasm. 
So let's get on with it. 

First, you need 20-30 feet of good nylon or polypropylene 
rope, a pair of hand-cuffs, some bungee cords, a wire coat 
hanger and a lighter. No, wait a minute...that was my last 
girlfriend. 

Let's start simple. Sex for a woman is as much psychological 
as it is physical. So it is important, on occasions when you 
know you're going to be stuffing the sausage, to create the 
proper emotional mood. 

Following are a few simple elements you can employ to help 
create an environment conducive to love. 

1. Plenty of hard liquor. 
2. Lithium
3. A shower (with soap)
4. A clean, comfortable, private area, preferably devoid of 
  any livestock. 
5. More liquor (trust me...you'll need it.)

Once you have liquored up your date--I mean--set the mood, 
you must invest in at least five minutes worth of kissing. 
This lends an illusion of intimacy to the occasion which 
will make her feel more comfortable with you. And remember, 
a comfortable date is an orgasmic date. 

Cautionary note...if you can feel her tonsils with the tip 
of your tongue you lose some of the intimacy. 

The process of removing her clothes and getting her into the 
bedroom (or stirrups, whatever) is academic for the purposes 
of this discussion. I am assuming that you have already found 
someone retarded enough to let you put your tic-tac sized 
pecker inside her chum bucket. The point here is to bring 
her to orgasm while doing that. 

Since I'm already late for happy hour at the Boom-Boom Room, 
I'm going to continue this next week. Make sure to tune in 
for...

The Five Essential Steps for Foreplay
Sweet Nothings: What To Say During Coitus
and "The Donkey Punch": When and When Not to Use It. 

I need a drink,

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> READER'S COMMENTS <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< 

You say you fucked a fat chick last New Years eve and it got 
me to thinking.  Do you think that a really, really fat man 
and woman can fuck each other?  Or would their stomachs get 
in the way?  I have been going over this in my mind, and it 
is not a pretty sight and I figured if anyone had the answer 
it would be you. --Laurel 
[I don't know...why don't you find a guy with a really big 
beer belly and experiment. You don't have to bother letting 
me know the results.]


Oh Chadwick, that was a terrible thing you said to Melissa! 
About the stretched out horse pussy! I damn near puked from 
laughing! --Donna
[How attractive. Thanks for sharing.]


Chadwick, can I fuck you just once to see what your really 
made of? --sharon barakat
[Sure. Send pic. Preferably in underwear.]


some fuckin body...for God's sake.....buy some of this shit 
to get Chad off our cum covered backs...and to the dick weed 
from Canada.....stop bitchin!!!  I hate to have to tity slap 
you too! --Angela
[Listen to titty-woman, here, you cheap bastards, and get 
start reading some God-damned ads.]


hey chadwick...what the fuck is pedastery...I am in my third 
year of college and have no fucking clue what you are talking 
about. -william
[Well...whatever college you're going to I'm pretty sure it's 
not divinity school if you don't know what pederasty is.]


Thank you my dear, but a gun is something I have already...I 
don't think he's worth shooting, really....I think the man's 
more into cake than I realised......never having liked cake, 
I cannot grasp his desire for it...Darla
[No, cum-for-brains, I said I have a gun because...oh, never-
mind. Trying to explain things to you cock-roaches gives me 
a headache. If you want my suggestion...sell the gun and buy 
some drugs. You sound like you need it.]


Well, well, well...Looks like you didn't publish my last re-
spones. Tis a shame to let all that those great remarks go 
to shame, but then again you wouldn't want your whores know 
that a woman put you in your place, would we? Yes it is I, 
the woman who has vowed to make your life a living hell till 
satisfaction is achieved. Well,I feel like letting you spend 
a minute trying to figure my motive, my reasoning. Meanwhile 
I will be going to sleep because my boyfriend is calling for 
me. Later Limp Dick--Ashley Wood
[You're a woman alright. A man expresses a little interest 
and you go right to sleep.]
