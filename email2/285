How Much Time Does It Take To Stay Healthy?

(Cox News Service) -- Experts agree that physical activity is key
to good health.  But for many, the agreement ends there.

Obesity In Middle Age Cuts Years Off Life

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- People who are overweight at 40 are likely
to die at least three years sooner than those who are slim,
meaning that in terms of life expectancy, being fat during middle
age is just as bad as smoking, researchers say.

Vitamin C, Fish, And A Gout Drug Target Artery Damage From
Smoking

DALLAS (American Heart Association) -- Researchers found that
vitamin C and taurine, an amino acid in fish, reversed abnormal
blood vessel response associated with cigarette smoking - a
discovery that may provide insight into how smoking contributes
to "hardening of the arteries," according to an Irish study.

Pediatricians Have Important Role In Identifying And Treating
Eating Disorders

CHICAGO (AAP) -- According to a new policy statement from the
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) entitled, 'Identifying and
Treating Eating Disorders,' primary care pediatricians are in a
unique position to detect the onset of eating disorders and stop
their progression at the earliest stages of the illness.

Weight-Loss Experts Say Adults Must Go Slowly, Set Better Example

(USA TODAY) -- When adults want to lose weight, they often revamp
their eating and exercise habits by choosing healthier foods and
being more active.  But losing weight is trickier for children
and adolescents who have to eat what their parents buy or their
schools serve and do the sports and activities that are available
to them, pediatric weight-loss experts say.

Winter Fitness
It's tempting to just hibernate indoors during the cold-weather months with your feet up by a warm fire. Tempting, but not healthful. For even though bears hibernate, there are good reasons for humans to leave their dens.
