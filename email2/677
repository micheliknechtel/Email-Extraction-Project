Hello All!

When reading the reviews for Dave Grohl and all three of his
bands, I have come to find out that many of you like what he 
is doing along with the music he is making. There were others,
although, who did not agree. So here are your reviews for 
"All My Life", "No One Knows", and "You Know You're Right"...

"I don't think Grohl is spreading himself thin at all. He is 
really only working in two bands, as Nirvana was a past 
project."
		-Paige

"Although Dave was great in Nirvana and in Foo Fighters, I 
really do not like him in the band, Queens of the Stone Age.
His best work is Foo Fighters and right now, they are 
slacking."
		Dave

"Dave Grohl is awesome.  I'm glad he is dominating the rock 
scene.  Hopefully this is a sign that the rock scene will make 
a come back.  However, I doubt really good music like emo, 
ska, punk, and hard rock will ever make it mainstream..."
		-Leslie

Well, there you have it. I liked all the music Dave Grohl 
made with Nirvana and the Foo Fighters. His new song, "No
One Knows" by the band Queens of the Stone Age is a good 
track, but it can not be compared to any of the other 
work Dave has done with Nirvana and the Foo Fighters. All 
in all, I can agree with Dave's comments in that his best 
work is with the Foo Fighters.

For this week, I would like to know what you all think of 
the futuristic movie from last year, "Minority Report". Do you
think it was all what it was cracked up to be? Email me and
let me know what you think.

Until next week,

Kim
