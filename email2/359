Paint Prep Primer...Effective Caulking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Successful painting projects require successful surface 
preparation. In many cases, knowing how to use caulks 
will help. To that end we offer the following helpful tips 
for neater, more effective caulking. First, carefully 
inspect joints, gaps or seams before you begin. In new 
construction, make sure the adjacent surfaces are 
clean, dry and dust-free. If the surface was previously 
caulked, remove as much of the old material as 
possible, especially any that has cracked, eroded, or 
pulled away from the joint -- material that can prevent 
new caulk from adhering properly. The next step is to 
scrape or sand to remove any loose or flaking paint 
near the joint. Follow with a thorough soap-and-water 
solution cleansing. Add a bit of bleach to the solution 
to eliminate mildew. Finally, rinse the surface and let it 
dry completely before applying the new caulk.

These tips came from the caulking page... >> http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=95mk9tn6.norturn6.xkfc8tn6&p=http%3A%2F%2Fdoityourself.com%2Fpatch%2Fcaulktalking.htm

<b>Collect Calls...Digital Answering Machine</b>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It looks good and it takes messages, too. General 
Electric's convenient, compact and elegant digital 
answering machine lets you manage communication on 
the go. It records messages on a digital microchip to 
provide consistent voice quality and reliability. The 
machine features a message counter, a call screening 
speaker, the ability to erase any message instantly and 
skip any message to access the previous or next 
message, protection in the event of a power failure -- 
even a one year warranty. In short, it is a full-feature, 
reliable, and easy-to-use answering machine system 
that is available through DoItYourself.com for just 
$24.99! It's an offer that's hard to beat, like most of 
the 
bargains on our shopping pages. Never miss an 
important call. (Item is "while stock lasts"...sorry, no 
rain checks.)

<b>Counter Demonstration...Countertop Installation Tutorial</b>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Learning from mistakes is probably the most effective 
kind of learning, but no one says you have to make 
those mistakes yourself. When it comes to installation 
of pre-formed kitchen countertops, our tutorial starts 
with the most common mistakes of homeowners, 
handymen and pros. For instance, neglecting to sand a 
countertop to the contours of the wall can result in 
unsightly gaps. Cutting the sink opening to the wrong 
position or dimension is cause for aggravation. And 
scratching or puncturing the countertop during 
installation can leave your kitchen counter with a 
permanent scar of failure. With these things in mind, 
proceed to the detailed instructions at our installation 
page: size selection, measuring instructions, cutting 
care, fitting, and fastening.

It's comprehensive, clear, and a click away... >> http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=95mk9tn6.norturn6.ukfc8tn6&p=http%3A%2F%2Fdoityourself.com%2Fkitchen%2Fk-preformed.htm

<b>A Cinch...Ratcheting Tie Downs</b>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When it comes to loading up pick-ups or transporting 
motorcycles or ATVs, is there anything more 
embarrassing than pulling up -- displaying an aire of 
handy capability -- loading the rig, and then suddenly 
being reduced to scrounging for twine or bungee cords? 
Not so capable. If so, it's time to get yourself a set of 
ratchetiing tie downs, just like the big boys use. The 
only notable difference is, where others may have paid 
the full $22.95 to $20.95 for a four-piece set, you will 
get quartette of 15-foot  nylon webbing wonders for 
just $16.99. Save 25%! The quick and easy release 
won't loosen with road vibration. The heat treated and 
vinyl-covered steel S hooks will not buckle. So practice 
that can-do attitude and send for your ratcheting ties. 
They'll make secure packing and hauling easier than 
ever before. (Item is "while stock still lasts"...sorry, no 
rain checks.)

<b>A Good Soaking...Fertilize With Epsom Salts</b>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In many plants, magnesium is critical for seed 
germination as well as the production of chlorophyl, 
fruit and nuts. Soil magnesium deficiency may be one 
reason tomato leaves turn yellow or why fruit 
production slows. Adequate levels of magnesium can 
help roses produce darker green foliage and more new 
canes at the bottom breaks. It is also a compound that 
gives flavor to vegetables such as broccoli and onions. 
Although dolomitic lime and Sul-Po-Mag are also 
inexpensive ways to add magnesium, Epsom salts -- 
hydrated magnesium sulfate -- are extremely soluble. 
When diluted with water, and especially when applied 
as a foliar spray, Epsom salts can be taken up quickly 
by plants. Just apply one tablespoon of granules around 
each transplant, or spray a solution of one tablespoon 
per gallon of water at transplanting, at first flowering, 
and at fruit set.

        Learning from mistakes is probably the most effective=20
kind of learning, but no one says you have to make=20
those mistakes yourself. When it comes to installation=20
of pre-formed kitchen countertops, our tutorial starts=20
with the most common mistakes of homeowners,=20
handymen and pros. For instance, neglecting to sand a=20
countertop to the contours of the wall can result in=20
unsightly gaps. Cutting the sink opening to the wrong=20
position or dimension is cause for aggravation. And=20
scratching or puncturing the countertop during=20
installation can leave your kitchen counter with a=20
permanent scar of failure. With these things in mind,=20
proceed to the detailed instructions at our installation=20
page: size selection, measuring instructions, cutting=20
care, fitting, and fastening.

        In many plants, magnesium is critical for seed=20
germination as well as the production of chlorophyl,=20
fruit and nuts. Soil magnesium deficiency may be one=20
reason tomato leaves turn yellow or why fruit=20
production slows. Adequate levels of magnesium can=20

canes at the bottom breaks. It is also a compound that=20

Although dolomitic lime and Sul-Po-Mag are also=20
inexpensive ways to add magnesium, Epsom salts --=20
hydrated magnesium sulfate -- are extremely soluble.=20
When diluted with water, and especially when applied=20
as a foliar spray, Epsom salts can be taken up quickly=20
by plants. Just apply one tablespoon of granules around=20
each transplant, or spray a solution of one tablespoon=20

and at fruit set.

        Successful painting projects require successful surface=20
preparation. In many cases, knowing how to use caulks=20
will help. To that end we offer the following helpful tips=20
for neater, more effective caulking. First, carefully=20
inspect joints, gaps or seams before you begin. In new=20
construction, make sure the adjacent surfaces are=20
clean, dry and dust-free. If the surface was previously=20
caulked, remove as much of the old material as=20
possible, especially any that has cracked, eroded, or=20
pulled away from the joint -- material that can prevent=20
new caulk from adhering properly. The next step is to=20
scrape or sand to remove any loose or flaking paint=20
near the joint. Follow with a thorough soap-and-water=20
solution cleansing. Add a bit of bleach to the solution=20
to eliminate mildew. Finally, rinse the surface and let it=20
dry completely before applying the new caulk.
