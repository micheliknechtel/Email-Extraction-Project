A splint or brace can take the pressure off joints, especially in the 
wrist or hand, and protect them from injury.

If you have arthritis, regular exercise may help, provided the exercise
program is tailored to your needs and abilities and is combined with an 
appropriate amount of recovery time.

Winter Fitness
It's tempting to just hibernate indoors during the cold-weather months 
with your feet up by a warm fire. Tempting, but not healthful. For even
though bears hibernate, there are good reasons for humans to leave their dens.
