1. What is blogging? - Ask Bruce Question of the week   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Blogging is a way of collecting links to pages you visit often and making comments about them that other people can see. They're great because they have really personal reviews of websites. 

They're also really easy to make so you can have one even if you aren't very technical, so take a look at Ask Bruce.

2. Portable player unlocks net radio
 --------------------------------------------

An innovative radio that lets you listen to internet stations anywhere in the home has been showcased at the world's largest consumer technology event in Las Vegas. A radio that connects to a computer wirelessly, providing access to any music on the PC or to thousands of internet radio stations.
