IN THIS ISSUE: 

1. TEEING OFF -  Tiger's Approach
2. DON'T MISS IT -  Long Drivers Of America
3. OUOTE OF THE WEEK 




                        TEEING OFF

          No Achilles in Tiger's approach to game

As a newborn, Achilles' mother dangled him by his heels in
the eternal fire to make him invincible, and for the most
part it worked - except, of course, for a small spot on the
back of each foot. And as Homer tells us, partial invinci-
bility is a dangerous thing. Opponents looking for a weak-
ness can spot one a mile away. Even if the hero's powers
seem magical there is always that one unguarded moment that
offers an opening - Excaliber is purloined or the magic
ring is fumbled away, leaving the once powerful suddenly
defenseless. The safest bet is to dispense with magic rings
and enchanted swords and focus on making the source of your
power come from within, not from without. A case in point
is Tiger Woods. The power in his world comes from only one
source - himself. And while no one is perfect in the world
of golf, Tiger Woods is about as close as anyone can come.
This is not to say he doesn't learn from experts, but he
uses them as a resource, not a crutch. Their knowledge is
nourishment that, once digested, becomes part of the inner
Tiger. He takes ownership and therefore is no longer forced
to rely on an external power source. Too many tour players
use experts as external props to shore up their weaknesses.
Remove the prop (a valued caddy, a favorite driver, a trust-
ed swing guru) and their golfing world spins out of control.
It's a fragile world when your power comes from without.
Tiger has friends, but not many close ones, and that's by
design - a part of the internal power plan. He has an entour-
age, a Tiger Team, an insider group more private than a
Howard Hughes hideaway, but they all have a short half-life.
Tiger once had a sports psychologist, now he doesn't. He had
a swing coach, now he does it himself. He had a trusted cad-
dy, but fired him, now he has another. The same with his
girlfriend. For Tiger there is no "team" in I. Tiger's father
trained him for toughness, using techniques borrowed from mil-
itary interrogation, which is just the ticket for a game like
golf. Standing over your ball on the 18th tee come Sunday,
it's you and you alone who has to pull the trigger, so you
better have a fully stocked larder of internal power to carry
you through. Achilles went to his final battle covered from
head to toe in armor when he should have been covered from
head to heel. An arrow struck him in the heel and down he
went. Such is the fate of heroes who rely on external props
for their well being. Tiger Woods has built his game so he
is not too reliant on any one person. The result is consis-
tency.
