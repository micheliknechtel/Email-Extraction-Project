Good Morning!!! 

Yesterday was a productive day around here. Flyboy finished
fixing the underground sprinklers that Keno had dug up a week
ago. A pilot he flew with last week told him that dogs don't
like the way chicken wire feels on their paws and to cut up 
strips and lay them over the hoses before covering them up with 
the rock and dirt...Flyboy went around the yard like a tunneling
fool and chicken wired the whole yard. Guess you could call him
a "wired Flier" after all of that...

We worked out in the yard a few hours trimming bushes and tackling
the weeds that seem to have come out of nowhere the last few days.
If only our lawn was as green as those weeds. 

We then took "the boys" to Petsmart for our weekly shopping of
dog food, toy replacements, and visit with their employee pals
who have come to know them from their visits. I discovered, quite
by accident, a beauty tip while I was walking EInstein and thought
I would share it with you before I go...We've talked about lip
plumping a few times in the past and the best, most inexpensive
way to achieve the look. Well, I can tell you a way that doesn't
cost a dime, lasts quite a while, and the results are immediate...
How you ask? Simple...Get a Great Dane...have him sit...while
he's sitting, bend over to talk to him and have him stand up...
When his head hits you in the mouth, your lips will swell INSTANTLY
giving you the "Angelina Jolie suction cup" look...It doesn't
matter that your teeth rattle a little, it's the plumped look
you've been dying to get! And the best part? 4 hours later you
still have "the look."

Keep On Looking Good!!! 

:-) 

Jamie

Today, we'll try to get through something we all have, no, not
crazy relatives...Bad hair days. They're inevitable at one time
or another or more often than not. Here are a few tips that may
help minimize the frequency of those days that make you wish you
could wear a hat all day...

A good haircut...This is probably the biggest key to having less
"bad hair days" A good cut will allow your hair to fall into place
with the least amount of work. If you get a haircut and the stylist
spends a lot of time styling it, chances are you'll never be able
to do it yourself at home. A good cut will work with your natural
texture and type, not try to hide it. Try hiding your texture and
type of hair and you're asking for bad hair days because you will
always be fighting with it rather than going with it.

Clients...Talk to the stylist and be honest about your hair with 
them. Tell them the problems you have with your hair and decide
together what will work for your particular type of hair.

Stylists...LISTEN to what the client is telling you. Don't "tune 
them out" because you feel you're the professional and know more
than they do. They know THEIR hair.

In the 29 years I have been a cosmetologist, I have heard these
two complaints more times than I can count...Why did I hear them?
'Cuz I LISTENED... :-)

Don't overuse products on your hair thinking you will get a bad
hair day to go good. You'll end up making it worse. Less is more 
when using products on your hair. Too much conditioner? Hair that
will end up limp, flyaway, or oily. Too much styling products?
Hair will again, be limp and get dull looking from product buildup...

Apply any hair styling product to damp, not wet hair.

Rollers have made a come-back recently. Set hair that is damp
and allow to dry naturally or speed the drying with a blow dryer
or hair dryer. If you like the natural tossled look, carefully
remove the rollers, (allow electric curlers to cool completely
before removing) bend over and gently finger comb the curls through.
When you stand back up and the room has stopped spinning, lightly
spray the hair and...leave it alone, don't keep playing with it or
your cute look will quickly turn into a "bad hair day."

When blow drying hair, apply your styling product to the roots
with very little, if any anywhere else. Blow dry the roots to
give your hair added body before finishing the rest of the hair.

If you have a cowlick, use a little gel or mousse to tame it,
or use that area to try out different parts. If the cowlick is
in the crown or back of the head, use a roller or two to get it
under control. (Curling iron works too).
Most gels and mousse can be re-activated by spritzing the hair 
with a little water if you hair falls during the day. Spritz and 
gently use your fingers to fluff the style back up...

I hope some of these tips can help you cut down the amount of bad
hair days. One of my personal favorite tips for bad hair days
that I use probably dozens of times a week (I know, that's a lot
of bad hair days.) is throwing my hair on top of my head. Sure,
I sometimes look like "Psycho Pebbles", but at least it always
looks neat and no one realizes I wrestled with the hair before
I ended up with the look...
