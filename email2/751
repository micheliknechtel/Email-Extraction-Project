Brooke to comfort him. Eric assures Brooke that he'll get rid 
of Deacon before anyone knows he's in Italy. Eric convinces

never consider a life with Deacon if she's afraid of him. As 
Eric leads Deacon out, they run into Brooke and Ridge in the 
hall. Sally fumes as Stephanie courts the press, but when she 
confronts her, it's Sally who ends up all wet. Darla refuses 
to give away Macy's whereabouts, but agrees to pass a message 
along for Thorne. Darla is disappointed when she learns Macy 
intends on leaving Italy with Lorenzo and Adam. While Lorenzo 
and Adam are out making arrangements, Macy leaves for the 
church to meet with Thorne per Darla's instructions. When 
Deacon demands to speak with Brooke alone, Ridge and Deacon 
come to blows. Brooke gets Deacon to back down, and he 
reluctantly leaves with Eric. Brooke later discovers a 
heart-shaped doodle with her name on it in Deacon's hotel 
room, which she hides from Ridge. Bridget promises Stephanie 
she will keep Ridge's paternity a secret, but she's 
uncomfortable because she already feels a change in her 
relationship with Ridge. Lorenzo and Adam search for Macy. 
Macy arrives at the church and Thorne is overwhelmed with joy
at seeing her there. Last minute preparations are being nailed

Here's what's coming up next on THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS: 

Paul brings up Diane, sensing Andy may still have feelings for 
her. Lily is upset and resentful. 

Here's what just happened on THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS: 

Jack is disgusted that Diane has succeeded in canceling his 
play date with Kyle. Phyllis is optimistic that Diane will 
be in jail soon, but Jack tells her that Silva is not 
convinced Diane will be prosecuted, let alone convicted. Jack 
is eager to tell Phyllis about his plan to gain custody of 
Kyle. Later, Jack visits Diane's hotel suite and tells her 
that it is only a matter of time before she's sent to jail. 
He tells her that Det. Weber has requested that he and 
Phyllis assist him with the case. Jack offers his "help" to 
Diane, saying that he and Phyllis are willing to "forget" 
about Diane's dirty deeds if Diane gives him custody of Kyle. 
Diane says she will think about it, but Jack warns her not to 
wait too long. Later, Isabella visits and Diane tells her 
about Jack's proposal. Though Isabella questions Diane's 
innocence, Diane insists she did not set the fire. She tells 
Isabella that she has asked Michael to represent her, but is 
doubtful that he'll take her case. Diane is determined to 
stay strong for Kyle's sake, and vows not to lose her son. 
Olivia visits Ashley, asking if she's told Brad the truth yet. 
Ashley resents the intrusion, and assures Olivia she will 
tell Brad that evening. Later, Brad arrives and is prepared 
to discuss Abby's biological father. He is stunned when 
Ashley reveals that the sperm she used was Victor Newman's. 
Brad cannot believe that she's kept the information from him. 
Ashley tries to make Brad understand that, in her eyes, Abby 
will always be their daughter but Brad remains upset and 
leaves. Olivia is surprised when Victor arrives in her office. 
He tells her that he's worried about Ashley, and hopes Olivia 
can help. He explains that Ashley has asked him to keep his 
distance. Olivia tells him that she hasn't been in contact 
with Ashley lately and isn't aware of anything wrong. Victor 
wonders if Brad is cheating on Ashley, but Olivia denounces 
the accusation. Victor senses Olivia knows more. When he 
presses, Olivia asks him to leave. Victor threatens to 
confront Ashley after all, but Olivia advises him to wait 
for Ashley to make the first move. When Olivia visits Neil, 
he warns her to stay away from Brad because he's a married 
man. Instead, he encourages her to spend more time with Wes, 
which would give him time to make inroads with Dru. After 
Olivia leaves, Lily tells Neil that she's upset with Wes for 
destroying their trip to Paris. Neil explains the trip 
cancellation wasn't Wes' fault, but that it was Dru and Neil 
who wanted Lily to stay.
