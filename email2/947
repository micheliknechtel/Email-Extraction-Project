Today's List-A-Day Biz Review: Tradeshow Bluesletter

Is there a trade show in your future? They're fun if you're a
visitor, but they're a lot of work for the people who have to
set up the booths, make contacts and try to woo new customers
away from the scantily clad models three booths away. This 
newsletter is like a trade show in miniature: serious business 
gets done, but with fun and a little attitude.

Editor Jeffery D. Brown turns out consistently good newsletters 
that examine important issues for trade-show participants and
event planners alike, along with news and information for more
effective presentations. You'll even get news about trade shows
for trade-show people. It markets itself as the newsletter for
"the tradeshow and event enthusiast;" so, if you count yourself
one of those, this newsletter is for you.
