Greetings Laff Lovers,

Our head geek was saying goodnight to a group of us slaves 
that were gathered around the conference table.

"Leaving early?" asked Satan with a raised brow.

"Yes," he replied nervously. "I have to stop at the drugstore 
to pickup a 'patch' subscription for my wife. She's quitting 
smoking today."

"Good luck to her!" everyone said at once.

"Yeah, lucky me," grinned Mr. IT. "I told her to let me know 
any time she has an urge to put something in her mouth to 
suck on."

Habitually,

TZ

Albert Einstein married his cousin. He had tried to date 
outside his family circle, but he never found any of the 
other women appealing--especially in the boob department-that 
weren't within his familial group. He postulated that there 
is a special attraction to women in one's own family in his 
Theory of Relative Titty.
   [This one got me.]

Mexican Police Officer: "So, do you know the criminal Pablo 
Sanchez?"

Juan (Just Taken Prisoner): "Know him? Yesterday, I am riding 
my horse, and the horse he stop to make droppings in the road. 
Pablo Sanchez step out from bushes, holding very big pistola
