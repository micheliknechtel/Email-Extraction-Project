((((((((((((((((( WEBREFERENCE UPDATE NEWSLETTER )))))))))))))))))
                        January 9, 2003

This week the big news is Apple's new Safari browser. Based on
Konquerer's KHTML, the Safari beta is at least 40% faster than
competing browsers in rendering HTML and executing JavaScript.
Of course the beta has some CSS rendering bugs, which the
developers are hard at work ironing out. Read the Safari roundup
later in this issue. In other voices Jakob finds an impressive
ROI for usability, and Webword reviews "The Elements of User
Experience."

Speaking of books... I'm pleased to announce that your humble
editor has finally written one, titled "Speed Up Your Site: Web
Site Optimization" from New Riders. As the name implies this book
shows you how to speed up your site to avoid the slow-loading
blues. Our first exclusive excerpt on speeding up JavaScript
launched on Wednesday, with more on the way.

1. OTHER VOICES: Return on Investment for Usability,
                  Book Review: The Elements of User Experience,
                  Who Had the Worst User Experience?

* Return on Investment for Usability

The average cost of usability is 10% of each project's budget.
Following a usability redesign, web sites increase usability by
135% on average.

* Book Review: The Elements of User Experience

"I wish that this book and the diagram upon which it is based
were available when I first attempted the design of user
experiences. It could have saved me from false starts, sub-optimal
choices, and other hard-won lessons, and would have made it much
easier for me to communicate my ideas to my fellow team members
and to the managers for whom I worked."

2. NET NEWS: Apple Launches New Browser at Macworld,
              Overture Gleeful Over Yahoo!-Inktomi Deal

* Apple Launches New Browser at Macworld

Apple's Steve Jobs announced a number of new products at this
week's Macworld in San Francisco. Safari, a fast new web browser,
is Apple's browsing solution for Mac OS 10.2x users. The Safari
beta is based on the open source Konquerer project. Apple claims
Safari is at least 40% faster than other browsers in HTML rendering
speed and JavaScript execution speed. However, early reports
indicate slower Flash ActionScript frame rates (which the
developer's claim they've now fixed), and some rendering
peculiarities. While Safari supports many standards, Mark Pilgrim
found a number of Safari CSS rendering bugs.

Safari can also confuse some browser sniffers, with its new
user agent string of:

Netscape 5.0 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-us)
   AppleWebKit/48 (like Gecko) Safari/48

Dave Hyatt, one of the Safari developers, explains why Apple
adopted this approach for DHTML script compatibility:

http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/2003_01_05_mozillian_archive.html

Dave Hyatt goes onto outline what standards Safari supports:

"KHTML supports much of DOM level 2 and CSS2, including the DOM
level 2 event model (e.g., mutation events too!) and rich selector
syntax (even a little bit of CSS3 selectors). In addition we have
added and fixed CSS support in a number of key areas, including
partial support for min/max-width, better support for z-index
(including support for auto z-indices), and better support for
the CSS white-space property."

Apple's quick response to these beta reports is heartening. Despite
these beta bugs Safari set a record for one-day downloads at
Apple.com. Speed sells.

* Overture Gleeful Over Yahoo!-Inktomi Deal

Having notched a series of recent wins against Google for paid
listings contracts, Overture was pleased to learn its rival might
soon feel even more pressure.
