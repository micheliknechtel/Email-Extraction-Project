DIGITAL CAMERAS PRICED OVER $500 PICK: FUJIFILM FINEPIX S602 ZOOM  

  
This 3.1-megapixel camera has a professional feel. It comes with a 6X 
optical zoom and 4.4X digital zoom, and it includes many exposure, 
focus, and navigational features.  

The FinePix resembles a film camera, and at 1.3 pounds is easy to hold 
in one hand while you operate its top-mounted controls for flash, 
exposure compensation, and autobracketing. The camera has a 
supersensitive, top-end ISO of 1600. Two media slots are available, 
one for a SmartMedia memory card (a 16MB card is bundled) and a second 
for a CompactFlash card or a high-capacity IBM Microdrive. In 
addition, the camera can record movies with sound.  

Its five preset scene modes provide a range of exposure options 
helpful to novice photographers. You can change modes, set the 
exposure, and accomplish other advanced tasks fairly quickly. The S602 
Zoom's electronic viewfinder shows the same settings as the 1.5-inch 
LCD. When it's too bright outdoors to read the LCD, you can perform 
your work in the viewfinder.   

The FinePix includes a hot-shoe sync for an external flash. Also 
bundled is Adobe PhotoDeluxe and a videoconferencing program.  

The Fujifilm FinePix S602 Zoom typically sells for around $665. We 
found one with the PC World Product Finder for $505 from PCVideo 
Online.

CD-RW DRIVE PICK: PACIFIC DIGITAL MACH 48 CD-RW  

  
This speedy drive earned a Best Buy for its performance in CD-R 
mastering tests. The 48X/12X/48X also excelled in the writing test, 
and its speed was impressive when packet writing to CD-RW media.  

The bundled software covers the basics. Included are Ahead Nero 
Burning ROM 5.5 for CD mastering and InCD 3.2 for packet writing. 
Pacific Digital says this drive supports the Mount Rainier 
specification, which is designed to eliminate the need to install 
hardware drivers and CD-burning programs in order to drag and drop 
files. However, the current edition of Windows XP doesn't support the 
standard.  

Pacific Digital provides 12 hours of toll-free technical support per 
day.  

The Pacific Digital Mach 48 CD-RW typically sells for around $90. We 
found one with the PC World Product Finder for $80 from OfficeMax.

19-INCH MONITOR PICK: NEC MULTISYNC FP955  

  
This professional display includes a five-port USB 1.1 hub. The ports 
are conveniently located on the rear of the base, so you can easily 
hook up USB devices such as mice or keyboards.   

The MultiSync displays consistently crisp text. Image quality was also 
fairly strong. The on-screen display is managed with seven buttons on 
the front of the bezel, which are explained well in the accompanying 
manual. Advanced controls include those for moiré and convergence.  

The monitor can be purchased with a hardware color calibrator that 
will appeal to graphics professionals. The monitor plus calibrator, 
called SpectraView, costs $1019. The calibrator, which makes the 
monitor valuable for professional graphics work, is not available 
separately.  

The NEC MultiSync FP955 was introduced priced at $380 and typically 
sells for around $360. We found one with the PC World Product Finder 
for $346 from Computers4Sure.com.
