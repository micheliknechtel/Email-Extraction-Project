1. NBC'S HADEN: SHANE WALTON IS MY MVP=20
Early in the season, NBC's Pat Haden nominated his top five candidates =
for Irish MVP. They were Shane Walton, a senior cornerback, junior =
cornerback Vontez Duff, senior center Jeff Faine, senior nose guard =
Cedric Hilliard and sophomore running back Ryan Grant. Find out why =
Walton ended up being both Haden's choice for MVP -- as well as the =
choice of the NBCSports.com readers, who took part in our poll on the =
topic.=20
http://www.msnbc.com/news/854212.asp?Oct=3D376=20
=20
2. IRISH DRAW POSITIVES FROM 2002 SEASON=20
The biggest positive for Notre Dame is that in his first year as coach =
Tyrone Willingham instilled a new spirit as the Irish went from 5-6 last =
season to 10-3, the third-best turnaround in school history and their =
most wins in nine years. But after starting 8-0, the Irish lost three of =
their last five games. So there is still work to be done as Notre Dame =
finished its 14th straight season without a national title and a =
school-record ninth straight season outside the Top 10.=20
http://www.msnbc.com/news/854146.asp?Oct=3D376=20
=20
3. KEY QUESTIONS FOR IRISH IN 2003=20
The Notre Dame offseason is not for dwelling on the achievement of going =
from five wins two years ago to 10 wins last season. Instead,the Irish =
are focusing on the key issues they face if they are to build on their =
success of 2002 in 2003. One of those issues is sorting out the running =
game. Find out more about that and other areas that are receiving the =
attention of the Notre Dame coaches this winter.=20
http://www.msnbc.com/news/859250.asp?Oct=3D376=20
=20
4. COYLE: WALTON, BATLLE IMPRESS AT SENIOR BOWL=20
Pro scout Frank Coyle spent the week in Mobile, Ala. watching closely as =
the nation's best college football players gathered for the Senior Bowl =
All-Star game in an effort to impress the numerous NFL scouts in =
attendance. Two of those to post solid showings this year were =
cornerback Shane Walton and wideout Arnaz Battle of Notre Dame. Coyle =
provides the break down on how they performed during practices and in =
the game. He also looks at their standing for April's NFL draft.=20
http://www.msnbc.com/news/866129.asp?Oct=3D376=20
=20
5. FAINE WON'T RETURN TO ND, WILL ENTER NFL DRAFT=20
Center Jeff Faine, a three-year starter for the Irish, won't be around =
to anchor the offensive line for a fourth season. Faine has elected to =
pass up a final year of college eligibility to enter the NFL draft, =
where he is considered a top prospect at his position. Find out how =
Faine went about making this big decision and see what his prospects are =
in the April NFL draft.=20
http://www.msnbc.com/news/857078.asp?Oct=3D376=20
=20
6. STATISICALLY SPEAKING, THE FINAL IRISH NUMBERS=20
The Notre Dame season is in the books and many Irish fans will be =
talking about over the long winter and right up until the start of =
spring practice. If you're one of those fans, don't get into any debate =
or discussion of Notre Dame football without knowing your numbers - or =
actually those of the key Irish players. Check out the final stats for =
Notre Dame on offense, defense and special teams.=20

a&cat=3Dtmstats&team=3D104=20
=20
7. WHO IS THE BEST NOTRE DAME RUNNNG BACK EVER?=20
Ryan Grant rushed for over 1,000 yards last season as a sophomore and =
some say he's only beginning to tap his potential. And Julius Jones, who =
has twice led the Irish in rushing, could be back on the team in 2003. =
But just who is the best ever to run the football for Notre Dame. Check =
out our short list and then weigh in with your opinion.=20
http://www.msnbc.com/news/769315.asp?Oct=3D-376=20
=20
8. VOTE FOR THE GREATEST COACH IS IRISH HISTORY=20
Tyrone Willingham, whose first season at Notre Dame was quite =
impressive, is following in the footsteps of some legendary Irish =
coaches. Take a look at the five coaches we think are in the argument =
for the distinction of being the greatest ever to guide the Blue and =
Gold. Then cast your vote for the one you feel is the best there ever =
was on the sidelines in South Bend.=20

9. GLIER'S CRYSTAL BALL REVEALS THE 2003 NATIONAL CHAMPION=20
It was just about a month ago that Ohio State was crowned college =
football's 2002 national champion after beating Miami in the Fiesta =
Bowl. The new season is seven months away from kicking off, but =
NBCSports.com contributor Ray Glier gets a head start on it by gazing =
into his crystal ball to tell us which team will be the 2003 national =
champion.=20
http://www.msnbc.com/news/854753.asp?Oct=3D-376=20
=20
10. RECRUITING WARS: TSN ON THE BATTLES FOR TOP 100 PREP STARS=20
College coaches go from getting their teams ready for games to hitting =
the road in hopes of landing top high school players, recruits who could =
play a huge role in their program's future success. The Sporting News' =
provides the latest edition of the Hot 100 high school football players =
and their school of choice -- or the schools they are considering.=20
