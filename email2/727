Greetings fellow Bizarros:

Exclusive Bizarre Interview!

Welcome bizarros to the first edition of the return of the
old format. In case you missed the message from last week 
and were wondering why you didn't receive the newsletter in 
the past few days, Bizarre News has gone back to the old 
format of mailing twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday 
with more content. 

I know I promised the Best of Bizarre 2002 this week, but a 
bizarre current event has grabbed my attention and I had to 
report to you.

By now many of you have heard about the claim that the first 
human clone has been born. What you may not know is who's 
claiming responsibility for the scientific breakthrough. A 
bizarre group that call themselves Raeliens says that they 
have found the solution to the cloning of human beings. 

In case you are unfamiliar with the term "Raelien," it refers 
to a person who believes that humans are the result of genetic 
experimentation by scientifically-advanced aliens. They feel 
that the origin of our planet and all its inhabitants comes 
from the engineering of intelligent extra-terrestrials. See-
ing as how the actions of the bizarre are my cup of tea, I 
was determined to track down one of these alien-followers to 
find out a little bit more about their beliefs. This man was 
kind enough to answer a few of my questions over the phone. 
He asked to remain anonymous, so we'll just call him E.T.

Lewis: What is it about the Raelien belief that captured your
       attention?

E.T.: Well, I've always felt the presence of another life 
      force, ever since I could remember. I guess the idea of 
      humans being the work of intelligent extra-terrestrials 
      seemed the most logical of all the other life-origin 
      tales I've heard.

Lewis: Have you ever had a personal alien encounter?

E.T.: Not yet, but I'm really hoping my time comes soon. I 
      have so many questions, so many images in my head... 
      I don't know if I'll be able to think of it all when the 
      time comes. 

Lewis: Do you worry about probes or anything like that?

E.T.: I don't think our creators would do anything to hurt us.  
      If they did need to use a probe, I don't see how it  
      would be any different than a trip to the proctologist.

Lewis: Point taken. Now, your people have claimed that the 
       first human clone has been born under your experimen-
       tation. Where does cloning fit in with the rest of the 
       Raelien beliefs?

E.T.: For Raeliens, we believe that cloning is the key to 
      eternal life. Through our research on AGP, accelerated 
      growth process, we believe it will some day be possible 
      for adult copies of humans to be fully developed within 
      hours.

Lewis: But what about the loss of individuality? If you create 
       a replica of yourself, isn't that just someone else who 
       looks like you and has your DNA? How does that make you 
       immortal?

For part two of my interview with E.T., make sure to check out
Bizarre News on Saturday. Next week I will be bringing you my
compilation of the BEST of the BIZARRE of 2002.

Bizarrely,

Lewis

+----------------- Bizarre Earth Science ------------------+
                           FACTS

Challenger Deep is the deepest spot in the ocean. It is 35,813 
feet deep. If you cut Mound Everest off at sea level and put 
it on the ocean bottom in the Challenger Deep, there would 
still be over a mile of water at the top.

Antarctica is the coldest, windiest and highest continent any-
where on earth. The sun rises and sets only ONCE A YEAR in the 
Antarctic, which means there are six months of daylight, fol-
lowed by six months of darkness.

The Dead Sea is almost six times as salty as the ocean. Noth-
ing lives in it. Fish that swim into it are instantly killed. 
But humans don't, and because of the high concentration of 
dissolved mineral salts in the water it's density is higher 
than fresh water, which in turn makes the human body more 
buoyant in the water. In short, you would bob up and down 
like a cork in the Dead Sea. 

                             ***


-------------------- Under Croc and Key --------------------

AKRON, Ohio - For safety, many people purchase guard dogs to 
protect their homes and belongings. One Ohio drug-dealer 
ditched the traditional dog idea and went with two boa con-
strictors and a four-foot alligator to guard his combination 
safe. Police carefully removed the animals to gain access to 
Arlander Ables' heavily guarded safe. What did Ables keep 
hidden in his reptile-protected metal box? About 50 porno-
graphic photos. Apparently the nudie pics were more valuable 
to the owner than the 5 grams of crack and 7 grams of mari-
juana police found not guarded by slithering cold-bloods.

--------------- Drunk Driving For Beginners ----------------

AUSTRALIA - The smart thing to do if you've had a little 
too much to drink is find yourself a designated driver to 
make sure you get home safely. The not-so-smart thing to do 
is to make that designated driver your five-year-old son. A 
37-year-old drunken mother had her youngest son man the wheel 
while she operated the pedals. The result was a devastating 
crash that injured the mother and her two sons when the car 
hit a tree, hurtled down an embankment and threw all three 
passengers from the car. The mother's condition was the most 
severe with back and neck injuries and facial lacerations. 
Her youngest son suffered a broken hand and the other sus-
tained only minor injuries. No further brain damage was 
reported on the woman.


----------------- You're Breaking My Balls -----------------

INDIA - If you take a look at the latest edition of the Guin-
ness Book of World Records, you will find that some people have 
performed extremely weird and painful acts just to get their 
names in the book. Bibhuti Bhushan Nayak is no exception. The 
34-year-old fitness expert claimed to have made his mark after 
three concrete blocks were smashed on his groin, defeating the 
previous record of two. His inspiration came from a karate ex-
pert he met in Japan who used his mind to perform extraordinary 
physical feats by numbing his nerves to any kind of pain. For 
his next feat, Nayak plans to break 50 baseball bats with his 
knee. His record would be a great story for his grandchildren, 
but he may have already eliminated any possibility of that 
happening.

----------------------- Hostage Hoax -----------------------

COPENHAGEN - "We have been taken hostage by two children. 
Hurry. Help us after the beep. Now!" This is the message 
a Danish family left on their answering machine - all in 
good fun, of course. But friends and family didn't get the 
joke. Instead they alerted authorities that the family was 
in trouble. In turn, an anti-terrorism squad raided the fam-
ily's home. Police blocked off the area, bombarded the house 
and soon found it was a false alarm. Apparently the confu-
sion was caused by misinterpretation of the message. Friends 
thought the message said, "We have been taken hostage WITH 
two children."


---------------------- Dead Body Dump ----------------------

HONG KONG - The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong's top 
university, apologized to police for sending them on a wild 
goose chase after they accidentally dumped human body parts 
in a landfill. Workers in the landfill found three lower tor-
sos, three right legs, two thighs and a left foot last week. 
Police discovered that the body parts had been injected with 
formaldehyde and traced them to the university. Lam Shiu-kam, 
a professor and dean of medicine, said the body parts were 
used by the faculty for research. The parts were then left 
behind when the department moved to a new building. When the 
building was being demolished the parts were mistaken for 
construction waste.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> READER COMMENTS <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


I read that you are going to a two-day schedule next week. 
Is that true? I always read Bizarre News the very last thing 
before I go to bed every night.  Now I am going to suffer 
insomnia. YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME! --Tillie
[Sorry. Each issue will, however, be almost twice as long. 
So you could just save half of it and read it the next night.]


You may be able to work this into a column in the future...
In China, pandas are shown "panda porn" to encourage mating 
in order to save the species.  I think the human race is in 
danger, and I have a VCR waiting to help me save it. -Kelley
[Are you suggesting that you're turned on by Panda porn? You 
know, they call people with your particular fetish 'furries.']


I am catching up on email and noticed a Type-O in 12/30's 
news-letter. You said "that would really 'peak' the in-
terest of the masses." where it should probably be 'pique'.
[A typo? In Bizarre News? Oh...the shame! Now I must commit 
ritualistic suicide by throwing myself on my keyboard.]


You're supposed to get drunk BEFORE you get naked and run 
around screaming "Come for me, oh creatures of the sky?" 
I've been doing this all wrong....Jadon 
[No, you're doing it right if you're taking Lithium.]


Lewis, you talk too much. 
[No I don't.]


Lewis, I really enjoy reading bizarre news but it seems to 
come to a close WAY before I am ready for it to.  Please 
help me exten my enjoyment of your newsletter. Thanks, Jon
[You got it.]


Dear Lewis, Thanks for keeping 2002 bizarre. I was in Mexico 
over New Year and was told by a friend about another bizarre 
tradition. Women in Mexico wear red underpants for luck. It 
is also very popular for co-workers to exchange underwear. 
When I freaked she assured me they each bring and exchange 
only a new unused pair, and here  all this time I thought 
you only got lucky when the pants came off! -Take care
[Hmmm...I wonder if I can get this tradition started with 
the women around the office. I won't tell them about the 
second part, though...]
