Notes from the Home Office

The weather in Seattle has been amazing this week -- sunny and 
high 40s everyday -- making it easy to keep my New Year's 
resolutions for exercise and generally put everyone in good 
spirits.  I don't know if the rest of the world is experiencing 
similar weather, but the activity at Recipezaar seems to 
suggest so.  As you can read about below, there are many new 
recipe contests, fun games to play and cooking friends being 
made.

I am personally perfecting my meatloaf-making skills and tonight's homework is Turkey Meatloaf with Creamy Horseradish Sauce ( http://www.recipezaar.com/40411 ).  Last week, we had the idea to make "personal meatloaves" where we made 6 tiny mounds so everyone got their one.  If you're craving a loaf, click for more recipe ideas ( http://www.recipezaar.com/search/search.zsp/meatloaf ).

The Cake Doctor Makes a House Call

The author of the "Cake Mix Doctor" books shows this author the secrets ( http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/08/dining/08CAKE.html ) to jazzing up the mixes.  "The thing about the mixes is that you can't mess them up.  They've been road-tested like the stell-belted tires on a car."  (New York Times -- free registration required)

Buy the books ( http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761117199/recipezaar-20 ) or get cake mix recipes ( http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getfood.zsp?sids[]=2466,3499,3614,6548,11749&title=cake+mix )

Seed Exchange

We know there are quite a few gardeners in our audience as well as cooks, which is why we have a forum for them to exchange tips: Gourmet Gardening and Such ( http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewforum.zsp?f=8 ).  Now they are taking it one step further and exchanging seeds ( http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=24508 ).  What a wonderful way to get new plants and vegetables from around the world.

Help with Your Diet Resolutions

Did you know that Recipezaar has dietary categories based on 
the FDA requirements for nutritional analysis of recipes?

Low Calorie ( http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/0FC116 )
Low Fat ( http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/0FC0A3 )
Low Carbs ( http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/0FC11F )
High Protein ( http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/0FC11E )
Low Sodium ( http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/0FC107 )
Healthy ( http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/0FC13A )

Start with any of those categories and filter down to the course or type of recipe you need -- and you won't be tempted.  Then you can add recipes to your "My Plan" ( http://www.recipezaar.com/myplan/ ) and Recipezaar automatically tracks the total calories and nutrients you eat in a day.  There is even a search engine for additing individual food items to your tracker (e.g. 1 apple, 1 diet soda, etc.).

Frequent Drinking Can Help Heart

Now that's what I like to hear ;-)!  ABCNews reports ( http://abcnews.go.com/wire/US/ap20030109_777.html ): "Those who drank at least three days a week had about one-third fewer heart attacks than did nondrinkers. And it made almost no difference whether the drinking consisted of half a drink or four...whether the beverage is beer, red wine, white wine or liquor."

To celebrate, get some new cocktail recipes ( http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/00D0520C3 )

Taking $5 Wine Seriously

We reported in this space last week that there is a big glut of wine which is thankfully driving prices down.  The LATimes wine staffers have done us a big favor and taste-tested 22 bottles from all over the world and all UNDER $5.  Check out the cheap wine scores ( http://www.latimes.com/features/food/la-fo-cheapgraphic8jan08001500,0,6501973.story ) (one you can only buy at 99 cents store scored the highest!)

Houdini Rabbit Corkscrew only $20

This corkscrew looks funny and works like butter ( http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068FNW/recipezaar-20 ). If you have never used one of these before it is a little scary, but once you master the technique you will NEVER go back to another corkscrew.  I still can't explain how it works but it is effortless to use.  No pressure or pulling necessary.  I have only seen these contraptions for more than $80, but Amazon is selling this one in blue or black for just $20, and you get a free foil cutter.  Get your cart to $25, and they'll ship free.

Boxed Set Books Sale

Amazon is clearing out the warehouse of Christmas gift sets and there are great deals on book sets ( http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=recipezaar-20&path=tg/feature/-/421415/outlet ) to be had.  Get all of the "Worst Cases Survival Handbooks" (travel, dating holidays, etc.), the "Smoothies Two Deck Set", Harry Potter all 4 in hardback for just $49, and a lot more...  Or check out the rest of the sale on all items ( http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=recipezaar-20&path=tg/browse/-/733804 ).

Still Going Strong: Mini-Prep Chopper only $13

The Cuisinart Mini-Chopper $35 OFF at Amazon ( http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005KAY3/recipezaar-20 ).    If you are like me, you would never buy one of these at the regular price of $50, but would love to have someone else mince the garlic or finely chop the onions for you, especially when they'll do it for only $13.  Of course it is dishwasher safe and if you get your cart up to $25, they'll ship it for free.  Heck buy 2 and give one as a gift!
