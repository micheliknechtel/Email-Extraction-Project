As humans, not counting hominid ancestors, we've been around for 120,000

invented only the other day, 10,000 years ago. So why are we still allergic,
still 1 in 100 of us schizophrenic, still so many showing factory faults
that an efficient production process should have culled? Well maybe the
faults can sometimes be advantages. Prof. John Bradshaw is a neurobiologist
at Monash University and he's been reflecting on this very conundrum.
