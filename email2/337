TODAY'S NEWS IN BRIEF


Etc...


Crikey! you fingerprint him

An intruder found hiding in the bushes at a nursing home in Derby, 
Western Australia, was tackled, had his mouth taped, and was tossed in 
a jail cell by authorities. But despite chasing an officer who tried to 
offer him water, the offender was released the next day and even given 
a ride home. No, it wasn't because his defense attorney threatened to 
sue. In this case, the intruder was a five-foot crocodile. Police 
surmise that the toothy reptile probably was looking for a cool retreat 
on a day when temperatures topped 111 degrees F.

ever heard of stove-top?

Speaking of animals and the law, chickens helped London police make a 
drug bust. A gunman holding a man hostage was allowed to order food 
from a friend. However, upon inspection by police, the chicken dinner 
was found to be stuffed with marijuana. The following day, the friend 
returned with more drug-filled chicken and was arrested. "We were 
delighted to see him again," a police source said.

In Oscars preview, critics give 'The Pianist' top honors

The Holocaust drama "The Pianist" won best picture, director, actor, 
and screenplay when The National Society of Film Critics announced its 
annual awards Saturday in New York. The group is comprised of writers 
for major US newspapers and magazines, and its picks are regarded as a 
precursor to nominations for the movie industry's top honors: the 
Academy Awards in March. A list of the winners in selected categories:

Best picture: "The Pianist"
Director: Roman Polanski, "The Pianist"
Actor: Adrien Brody, "The Pianist"
Actress: Diane Lane, "Unfaithful"
Supporting actor: Christopher Walken, "Catch Me If You Can"
Supporting actress: Patricia Clarkson, "Far From Heaven"
Screenplay: Ronald Harwood, "The Pianist"
Foreign language film: "Y Tu Mama Tambien"

Business & Finance


Most assets of bankrupt Bethlehem Steel Corp. are to be acquired by 
International Steel Group for up to $1.1 billion, The Wall Street 
Journal reported. The agreement, expected as early as Monday, 
reportedly would involve Bethlehem's main plants in Indiana and 
Illinois, plus another near Baltimore and some smaller facilities. It 
also would result in an estimated 4,000 job cuts and fewer benefits for 
remaining workers, the Journal said. International Steel is based in 
Cleveland. Bethlehem Steel is based in Bethlehem, Pa.

Carnival Corp. plans to submit a sweetened $5.4 billion takeover offer 
for P&O Princess Cruises PLC to European Union regulators, six months 
after winning approval for its original bid for the British company. An 
EU spokeswoman said the companies informed the European Commission on 
Monday of their decision to seek clearance "to obtain legal certainty" 
on the revised agreement, which was accepted by P&O Princess's board in 
October. P&O Princess spent much of last year fending off Carnival's 
approaches after agreeing to a "merger of equals" with Royal Caribbean, 
Carnival's top US rival.

The chief executive of BHP Billiton unexpectedly resigned over what the 
British-Australian mining giant called "irreconcilable differences" 
with its board of directors. Brian Gilbertson was a key architect of 
the $38 billion merger that created BHP Billiton in 2001, and share 
prices fell more than 3 percent on news of his departure. Executive 
director Chip Goodyear was named Gilbertson's replacement.

In one of the clearest signs yet that hybrid cars may be going 
mainstream, General Motors Corp. announced it would offer a variety of 
gas-and-electric vehicles over the next four years. Detroit-based GM, 
the world's largest automaker, said it would introduce hybrid models 
for cars, pickups, and sport utility vehicles.


USA


South Korean officials are in Washington for two days of talks, during 
which they're expected to unveil a proposal for easing tensions with 
nuclear-ambitious North Korea. While details of the proposal were not 
known as the Monitor went to press, it was expected to involve North 
Korean concessions on its nuclear weapons program in exchange for 
security guarantees. The talks will be followed by a visit to 
Washington later in the week by South Korea's national security 
adviser, Yim Sung-joon, and a trip to Seoul by assistant secretary of 
State James Kelly.

President Bush's national security team is assembling plans for a 
post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, including an American military presence in 
the country for at least 18 months, The New York Times reported. Citing 
administration officials, the Times said the plan also calls for 
military trials of the most senior Iraqi leaders and a quick takeover 
of the country's oil fields to pay for reconstruction. The effort would 
amount to the most ambitious American effort to administer a country 
since the occupations of Germany and Japan at the end of World War II.

At least 275 Army Reserve units - involving more than 10,000 soldiers - 
are on alert for deployment overseas as early as this week, according 
to USA Today. Defense Department sources told the paper that unit 
commanders were ordered to be ready to move out between Jan. 10 and 
Feb. 15 and that Reserves in the latest call-up would likely be sent to 
the Persian Gulf region, where US forces are massing.

The Republican Party selected New York for its 2004 national 
convention, a GOP official announced. Other finalists included New 
Orleans and Tampa-St. Petersburg, Florida, where Gov. Jeb Bush (R), the 
president's brother, worked hard for the honor. The convention is set 
for Aug. 30.

House Democrats were expected to unveil their economic stimulus package 
Monday, the day before Bush was to release his during a speech in 
Chicago. House minority leader, US Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D) of California, 
has said the focus of her party's plan will be job creation and that it 
will not cost as much as Bush's proposal. The latter is expected to 
carry a price tag of $600 billion over a decade. The president's plan 
is likely to include the elimination of taxes on shareholder dividends, 
in a move designed to boost the stock market after three years of 
losses.

The nation's last 2002 congressional race is over. Democrat Ed Case 
beat 43 other candidates in a special election to replace the late US 
Rep. Patsy Mink (D) of Hawaii. Case (below, with his wife, Audrey) won 
with 43 percent of the vote. He will be sworn in today when Congress 
convenes.


World


Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accused UN weapons inspectors of spying, 
dismissed US threats as "the hiss of snakes and bark of dogs," and said 
his country is prepared for war. His speech, televised (above) as part 
of Army Day celebrations, marked Hussein's first public criticism of 
the inspectors since they resumed work in November. In response, a UN 
spokeswoman said that if they are gathering intelligence, "it's 
intelligence for the United Nations." (Related story, page 2.)

Israel responded to two suicide bombings in Tel Aviv by rocketing 
suspected weapons workshops in Gaza City, blocking Palestinian 
officials from attending conferences in London and in the West Bank, 
and closing three Palestinian universities. The explosions killed 23 
people in addition to the bombers and wounded more than 100 others. 
Several Palestinian militant groups claimed responsibility. Analysts 
said the attacks, the deadliest since March 2001, were likely to boost 
strong support for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Likud government in 
Jan. 28 elections. (Story, page 1; editorial, page 10.)

Embattled Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez vowed "justice" for two 
supporters killed during a political rally in Caracas Friday. Chavez 
blamed leaders of a month-old strike by oil workers and opposition 
media outlets for the violence that left another 78 people injured. 
Opposition organizers accused Chavez supporters of starting the melee. 
The oil strike has cost the government billions and helped to push oil 
prices above $30 a barrel on international markets, although Chavez 
claimed exports are back to half the country's normal level. Venezuela 
is a major supplier to the US.

Three men detained in Hong Kong agreed to extradition to the US, where 
they face terrorism and drug-related charges. The suspects, two 
Pakistani nationals and an American born in India, were arrested in 
September in an FBI sting. They allegedly tried to trade drugs for four 
missile launchers, which they planned to sell to Al Qaeda. Hong Kong 
chief executive Tung Chee-hwa must approve the transfer, expected to 
take place in the next few weeks.

More than 210,000 candidates have registered for local council 
elections in Iran next month, the official IRNA news agency reported. 
Unlike previous polls, candidates who favor the reforms of President 
Mohammad Khatami will be allowed to run, setting the stage for a test 
of his popular support. Men and women as young as 15 are eligible to 
vote and young Iranians are among Khatami's main backers.
