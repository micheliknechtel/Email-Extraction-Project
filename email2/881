Yes!!  Hats off to CoD.  Now I'll be torn between UCAR and CoD for
all my quick & dirty model stuff.  I sure would like to see some
925/850 mb mixing ratio products, too -- those are hard to come by.

Those DIFAX charts are excellent and I'm sad to see them go.  However
I'm developing Truetype fonts for the NMC/NCEP products, and together
with upgrades in Digital Atmosphere and GRIB functionality I plan on
gearing Digital Atmosphere up to be able to duplicate DIFAX maps.
Of course these will be able to be distributed freely on the Internet.
These capabilities should make it into the next version late this winter.

  Afterwards, it filters through a 50 mile radius of air, where radios pick
up the transmission.  Atmospheric conditions such as air density, cloud
ceiling/cover! , type of weather, and humidity will also affect how a
transmission is transmitted, therefore totaling up to another 10 or 15
seconds before reaching to every radio.  Also before sending the
transmission from the office, the SAME codes are tacked on,

  None of those factors would delay radio reception by 10 to 15 seconds...

Does anyone know of a better wireless model?  Has anyone had problems with
this one?

If you have a better recomendation please let me know.

Um, the best reception we usually have is on the dry nights. However, I
don't believe that humidity will slow down a radio signal traveling 40-50
miles by 10-15 seconds... Now, if you are talking band openings under an
inversion, that's another story, but that will only increase the range that
the signal might be heard(by ducting), not the speed at which it travels...
