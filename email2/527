Dijit's Top 10 Funnies
For Jan. 31, 2003

Top 10 Signs We've Entered the Digital Age

10. Your grandmother asks you to send her a JPEG file of your newborn so she
can create a screen saver.

9. You consider second-day delivery for online purchases painfully slow.

8. You only stay in touch with friends & family who have email and can't
understand those who don't.

7. Using real money, instead of credit or debit, to make a purchase would be
a hassle and take planning.

6. You get an extra phone line so you can make phone calls.

5. You disconnect from the Internet and get this awful feeling, as if you
just pulled the plug on a loved one.

4. You start tilting your head sideways to smile. :)

3. You wake up at 3 AM to go to the bathroom and check your E-mail on your
way back to bed.

2. You're reading this and nodding and laughing.

1. Even worse, you know exactly who you are going to send this to.
