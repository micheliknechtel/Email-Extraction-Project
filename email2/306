	Welcome to HarperBizBytes,

	an e-mail newsletter from HarperBusiness, an imprint of
HarperCollins.

	In this edition, we highlight=20

	WHO SAYS ELEPHANTS CAN=92T DANCE?=20

	by=20

	Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.=20

	(HarperBusiness; November 12, 2002; $27.95)

	National Bestseller and=20

	a Business Week Best Business Book of 2002!

	LEARN LOU GERSTNER'S MANAGEMENT SECRETS IN

	WHO SAYS ELEPHANTS CAN=92T DANCE?

	During his nine years as the Chief Executive Officer of IBM,
Louis V. Gerstner, Jr., engineered one of the most dramatic comebacks in
business, taking IBM from the brink of disaster back to its place as a
preeminent global company.=20

	When Gerstner arrived at "Big Blue", the company had been
written off by many as a dinosaur soon to be rendered extinct by the PC
revolution. IBM was groaning under the weight of its own bureaucracy.
Gerstner wasted little time making the bold decision to keep IBM
together rather than splinter it into "Baby Blues." He then refocused
the company to compete in the marketplace.

	Only one person can tell this extraordinary story firsthand, and
that is Gerstner himself. In WHO SAYS ELEPHANTS CAN=92T DANCE Gerstner
delivers the inside perspective on the challenges IBM faced trying to
perform this daunting feat under intense public scrutiny.

	Written in an exciting, fast-paced narrative style, Gerstner
takes readers through his experiences at IBM -- from the high-powered
recruiting pressure to take the Chairman=92s position, to first days on
the job learning the strengths and weaknesses of IBM, to formulating and
successfully implementing a turnaround strategy.=20

	Filled with Gerstner=92s personal insights as he explores the
company, institutes changes, and rebuilds IBM for the 21st century,
readers will have unprecedented access to the mind of the CEO.
Refreshing and candid throughout, Gerstner pulls no punches as shows
readers what he did and why he did it.

	Gerstner on Success

	"I have learned there are three broad, fundamental
characteristics of successful enterprises and successful executives:
they are focused, they are superb at execution, they abound with
personal leadership."

=09

	Gerstner on Focus

	"At the end of the day a successful, focused enterprise is one
that has developed a deep understanding of its customers=92 needs, its
competitive environment, and its economic realities."

=09

	Gerstner on Strategy

	"Good strategies start with massive amounts of quantitative
analysis - hard, difficult analysis that is blended with wisdom,
insight, and risk taking. Truly great companies lay out strategies that
are believable and executable. Good strategies are long on detail and
short on vision."

=09

	Gerstner on Execution

	"Proper execution involves building measurable targets and
holding people accountable for them. Execution is the tough, difficult,
daily grind of making sure the machine moves forward meter by meter,
kilometer by kilometer, milestone by milestone."

=09

	Gerstner on Leadership

	"Great institutions are the length and shadow of individuals.
Great institutions are not managed; they are led. They are not
administered; they are driven to ever-increasing levels of
accomplishment by individuals who are passionate about winning."

=09

	Gerstner on Culture

	"I came to see, in my time at IBM, that culture isn't just one
aspect of the game--it is the game. In the end, an organization is
nothing more than the collective capacity of its people to create
value."

=09

	Gerstner on the Turnaround

	"Heading into IBM, I would have bet that the frenetic early
months would be the hardest work of my career. I would have bet wrong.
The second half of the 1990s would determine whether IBM was going to be
a company that mattered."
