DAILY Q&A

Q. WHAT'S AN "ALL RISKS" INSURANCE POLICY?

A. It's a term you'll commonly see on homeowner's insurance
policies. "All risks" means that you're covered for any kind of
loss to your property except causes that are specifically listed
as excluded. If your policy doesn't cover "all risks," you
probably have a "named perils" policy. Named perils policies
only cover your property losses when they're caused by perils
listed on the policy, such as fire, flood, hail, etc. If a peril
isn't listed, it's not included.

YOUR MONEY

RESOLVE TO SAVE MORE MONEY
In just 1 1/2 years, Fools have socked away $350 million in
savings. (Insert dramatic pause.) This is one time we recommend
that you follow the herd. What are you waiting for?

- TAKE A PAY CUT. Yup, you read that right. Successful saving
  requires giving yourself less money to spend -- it's that easy
  and we promise you won't miss it. Just come up with a dollar
  figure (don't overthink it) and vow to take a stab at socking
  it away. (Check out our Resolution Center to download a free
  Savings Kit. It's our way of helping you keep you motivated and
  on track.)
  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=798332

- MAKE SAVINGS A NO-BRAINER. As they say, out of sight (and off
  the "to do" list), out of mind. Set up a savings account that's
  separate from your regular checking account, and have some
  money automatically directed into it. With the account
  inaccessible by debit card, it'll be less tempting to break in
  and blow the balance.

- SUPERSIZE YOUR BALANCE with a savings account that earns the
  most interest. Check out the rates to the right on money market
  accounts and certificates of deposit with our sponsor, MBNA.
  They're some of the best that you'll find.

  into your overall financial plan. Sign up for TMF Money

SPOTLIGHT

SIX WAYS TO SAVE ON YOUR MORTGAGE
To get the best possible mortgage, you don't need to do it the
way everyone else does. In fact, if you're willing to educate
yourself in the ways of the mortgage world, you can save quite a
bit of money by being a little different. We've collected some
successful strategies that other Fools have used.

COMMUNITY TIPS

THE COST OF NOT HAVING A BUDGET
One of our more creative Community members looks back to the
future to calculate how much money he's wasted over the years.
If you need some inspiration to save more money, then this is
the Community Tip for you:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=798339

  My wife and I were talking at the kitchen table this morning
  while she was balancing the checkbook. Like many smart men, I
  leave such things to my wife, so I can attend to important
  things like U.S. foreign policy and whether to let Turkey into
  the European Union.

  My wife said rather proudly, "Eighty-five cents interest this
  month on the checking account. Add that to the interest on the
  savings account and we've got more than $30 this year."

  Boy she was excited about her $30. That'd barely buy you a
  dozen good golf balls. For crying out loud, that set me to
  thinking, what does that mean? So I thought of my pre-marital
  days, when I was more than a bit of a financial incompetent.
  No budget, minimal savings, credit card balances were high
  and savings balances were non existent, and every once in a
  while (more often than I care to admit) there were over-limit
  fees, late fees, returned check fees, fee fees, all sorts of
  bad things.

  So I found a financial calculator, made some assumptions, and
  reached some conclusions. Here were my assumptions:

  Starting at 25, I had a $2,500 Visa balance, which I kept
  until age 65. I went over my limit/bounced a check/paid late
  twice a year. That cost me $30 each time. I also got nicked
  for the bad-boy rate and paid 18% interest. I also was un-
  Foolish and paid a $59 annual fee. So the card each year cost
  me $450 interest, $60 in miscellaneous fees and $59 in an
  annual fee, for a total of $569.

  The sloppy checking practices I figured resulted in a half-
  dozen bounced checks a year at $25 each. Since I never
  carried enough of a balance to avoid fees/earn interest, the
  account itself cost me $7/month, or a total of $84. Total for
  that is $234.

  And then, because I don't have a budget, and I'm careless
  with cash, I visit an ATM 8-10 times per month. I try to use
  my banks machines, but I don't try real hard. So 4-5 times a
  month I pay $2 to use another bank's machine -- $8 per month
  is $96 per year.

  So the total cost of being less than efficient for me was $899
  per year. So if I could just get organized and not waste that
  money, but instead invest it until retirement, what would I
  gain? Were talking about nickels and dimes, right?

  I plugged in 8% annual return, which is well below the average
  return of the stock market. I figured someone would start at
  25, and continue until retirement at age 65. What does the
  total invested of $36859 become (that's an initial investment
  of $899 plus an additional $899 for 40 years): $279,172.42.

  All because my wife balances our checkbook and leaves me to
  worry about elections in Kenya. And I even ignored the $30/year
  we earn in interest on the checking and savings account.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>My wife and&nbsp;I were talking at the kitchen table this morning while she was balancing the checkbook. Like many smart
men,&nbsp;I leave such things to my wife, so&nbsp;I can attend to important things like&nbsp;U.S. foreign policy and whether
to let Turkey into the European Union.
<BR><BR>My wife said rather proudly, "Eighty-five cents interest this month on the checking
account. Add that to the interest on the savings account and we've got more than $30 this year."
<BR><BR>Boy she was excited
about her $30. That'd barely buy you a dozen good golf balls. For crying out loud, that set me to thinking, what does that
