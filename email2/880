* PLANNING FOR ALASKA IN 2003</b><br>
Each year it seems that the cruise lines can't possibly squeeze another ship into Alaska, but in 2003 they are continuing to add capacity in this perennially popular destination.  New ships joining the herd in 2003 include a former 688-passenger Renaissance vessel, now the Pacific Princess, which will sail roundtrip from San Francisco; and Princess' newest ship, the Coral Princess, scheduled for seven-night voyages between Vancouver and Seward (port of Anchorage).  Can't stand bingo and line dancing?  There are two dozen small ships giving you a much closer look at nature and a more initmate on-board experience.  If you want pampering and have the means to pay for it, try Radisson Seven Seas Cruises' Mariner or Crystal Cruises' Harmony..
<br><br>
CruiseMates has inaugurated the Internet's most comprehensive Alaska cruising coverage, providing a wide range of articles and information that can help you pick the right ship, pre- and post-cruise stays, land tours and shore excursions.
