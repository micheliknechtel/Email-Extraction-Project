+------------- NFL Admits Officiating Mistake -------------+

NEW YORK, NY - The National Football League admitted that 
game officials had botched a call at the end of the wild 
card playoff game between San Francisco and the New York 
Giants, thus costing the Giants a chance to win the game.
 
The Giants, having lost a 24-point lead and trailing by one 
point, attempted a 41-yard field goal with six seconds 
remaining. But the snap was bad and holder Matt Allen 
wound up throwing a desperation pass that headed in the 
direction of New York guard Rich Seubert.
 
Just before the ball arrived, however, Seubert was hit by 
San Francisco defensive end Chike Okeafor in what appeared 
to be obvious pass interference.
 
No flag was thrown for interference. Instead, the Giants 
were flagged for having an ineligible receiver downfield, 
thus ending the game. If interference had been called, 
there would have been offsetting penalties and the Giants 
would have had a second chance to kick the field goal.
 
Commentators on radio and television indicated that 
because Seubert was an ineligible receiver, no interference 
could be called. The league said, however, that Seubert was, 
indeed, an eligible receiver.
 
"The New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers were informed 
today that a defensive pass interference penalty should have 
been called on the final play of the game," the league said 
in a statement.
 
"A videotape review by NFL Director of Officiating Mike 
Pereira of the final play -- the Giants' 41-yard field goal 
attempt with six seconds remaining -- determined the 
following:
 
"Tam Hopkins of the Giants lined up as the left guard and 
was illegally downfield on the pass attempt. The three flags 
thrown on this play were for this penalty.
 
"Guard Rich Seubert was an eligible receiver on Giants field 
goal attempts. This was reported to the officiating crew 
prior to the game as is routinely done prior to every game.
 
"49ers defensive end Chike Okeafor interfered with Seubert 
downfield when he was attempting to catch Giants holder Matt 
Allen's pass. This defensive pass interference penalty 
against the 49ers was not called.
 
"If defensive pass interference had been called, there 
would have been offsetting penalties (ineligible receiver 
against the Giants and pass interference against the 49ers) 
with the down replayed at the original line of scrimmage, 
the San Francisco 23-yard line.
 
"Although time had expired, a game cannot end with offsetting
penalties. Thus, the game would have been extended by one 
untimed down."
 
The league also said that Allen did not have the option of 
spiking the ball to stop the clock once he fielded the poor 
snap.
 
"That only can be done by taking a hand-to-hand snap 
directly from the center," the league said. "If Allen had 
spiked the ball, it would have been a penalty for 
intentionally grounding the ball and the game would have 
ended due to a 10-second runoff of the clock."


+--------------- Favre Will Play Next Season --------------+

GREEN BAY, WI - Long-time Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre 
said he would play again in 2003.  Favre hinted at retirement 
before the Packers' surprising 27-7 loss to Atlanta in the 
NFC wild-card game, the first home-field setback in franchise 
history, and he stormed out of the stadium without talking 
to the media.
 
"As I said during the season, I have every intention of 
coming back and want to be back," Favre said. "I see no 
reason why this team shouldn't compete for a Super Bowl next 
year, or why I shouldn't be a part of it. Hopefully, we'll 
leave it at that and next year you all can start asking me 
the same (retirement) questions again. In my opinion we 
have nothing but great things to look forward to here."
 
The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that the Packers 
would take a $3.5 million salary cap hit if Favre retired, 
and the Packers would have to absorb about $9.3 million of 
his pro-rated signing bonus.
 
Favre still has eight years left on his current contract. 
He admits that he has been hampered by nagging injuries 
this season and that it is getting more difficult to bounce 
back.
 
Favre is a threat to win an unprecedented fourth MVP award. 
He was 325-of-518 (62.3 percent) for 3,486 yards, with 26 
touchdowns and 15 interceptions this season. His quarterback 
rating in the NFC was No. 4.

+----------- Eagles Say McNabb Will Be A Starter ----------+

PHILADELPHIA, PA - The Philadelphia Eagles announced that
Donovan McNabb will be a playoff starter at quarterback.  
Coach Andy Reid made the declaration on McNabb when the 
Eagles host Atlanta in an NFC Divisional playoff contest.
 
McNabb missed the last six regular season games after 
suffering a broken right ankle in a game Nov. 11 against 
Arizona. He returned to practice and pronounced himself 
ready to play, but Reid waited to make the official 
announcement.
 
"I'm comfortable with him (McNabb) right now," Reid said. 
"He'll continue to practice this week and sharpen 
everything up, and I'm not worried (about him). He's pain 
free, and has looked sharp between last week and today."
 
The Eagles went 5-1 in McNabb's absence, and clinched home
-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. They won at 
San Francisco on Nov. 25 with backup quarterback Koy Detmer, 
who dislocated his elbow in the game. Third-string 
quarterback A.J. Feeley then took over and won four of 
five starts.
 
McNabb, the NFL's highest-paid player with a $115 million 
contract, led the Eagles to a 7-3 record, completing 58 
percent of his passes for 2,289 yards and 17 touchdowns 
with six interceptions. He also rushed for 460 yards and 
six scores.  The two-time Pro Bowler led the Eagles to the 
NFC championship game last season.
 
As the Eagles' starting signal-caller, which came about near 
the end of his rookie campaign in 1999, McNabb has guided 
the Eagles to a 32-18 record, including three playoff wins.
 
He earned his second trip to the Pro Bowl following the 
2001 season after combining for 3,715 yards of total offense 
and establishing career highs in touchdown passes (25) and 
quarterback rating (84.3).
 
In his first full season as a starter, McNabb finished as 
runnerup in the NFL MVP voting after throwing for 3,365 
yards and 21 touchdowns.


+------------ Steelers Place Mike Morgan On IR ------------+

PITTSBURGH, PA - Pittsburgh Steelers safety Mike Logan, who 
had a pivotal interception in a come-from-behind playoff 
win over the Cleveland Browns, will miss the rest of the 
postseason with a right knee injury.   The Steelers placed 
Logan on injured reserve and signed rookie safety Erik 
Totten from the practice squad.
 
The Browns were leading 24-7 in the third quarter when Logan 
intercepted a pass by Kelly Holcomb and returned it 14 yards 
to the Pittsburgh 39. Tommy Maddox then directed a 10-play, 
71-yard touchdown drive and the Steelers went on to rally 
for a 36-33 victory.
 
Logan is the top backup at the safety position and is often 
used in nickel and dime packages.
 
Pittsburgh is in the divisional playoff round for the 
seventh time in 11 years under coach Bill Cowher and will 
visit the Tennessee Titans.

+------- Parcells Names Carthon Offense Coordinator -------+

IRVING, TX - Bill Parcells took less than a week to name his 
coordinators, turning to trusted friend Maurice Carthon to 
run the offense and leaving Mike Zimmer in charge of the 
defense for the Dallas Cowboys.
 
Carthon played under Parcells on both of his Super Bowl-
winning teams with the New York Giants and also served as 
an assistant under Parcells with the New England Patriots 
and New York Jets.
 
Carthon served as offensive coordinator of the Detroit 
Lions this past season after originally joining the team as 
the running backs coach in 2001.
 
Zimmer has directed the Cowboys' defense for the last three 
years under former coach Dave Campo. This past season, 
Dallas ranked 13th in points allowed and yielded 17 or fewer 
seven times.  
 
Known as a bruising blocking fullback, Carthon played six 
years under Parcells in New York. He began his coaching 
career in New England in 1994 as an offensive assistant 
and shifted to coaching running backs in 1995. Carthon 
followed Parcells to the Jets in 1997 and served as 
assistant head coach and running backs coach.
 
Prior to being promoted to defensive coordinator by Campo 
in February 2000, Zimmer spent five years as Cowboys' 
defensive backs coach and a year as a defensive assistant 
working with the nickel defense.  


+----------- 15 Finalists Named For Hall Of Fame ----------+

CANTON, OH - The Pro Football Hall of Fame put 15 finalists 
on its list for 2003.  Among the 15 is Marcus Allen, the 
first player in NFL history to rush for 10,000-plus yards 
and catch passes for 5,000 more. He is one of two first-time 
eligibles among the 15.
 
Seven previous finalists -- wide receivers Art Monk and 
James Lofton, quarterback Ken Stabler, guard Bob Kuechenberg, 
linebacker Harry Carson, cornerback Lester Hayes, and Buffalo 
Bills owner Ralph Wilson -- qualified as finalists again this 
year.

Linebacker Randy Gradishar and former general manager George 
Young are among six that had been eligible for Hall of Fame 
election prior to this year but had not been finalists. The 
others are defensive ends Elvin Bethea and Claude Humphrey, 
guard Joe DeLamielleure, and coach Hank Stram, the 
recommended nominee of the Hall's Seniors Committee.
 
Tackle Gary Zimmerman joins Allen as the only first-time 
eligibles under consideration.
 
The modern era finalists were determined by a vote of the 
Hall's 39-member Board of Selectors. The Class of 2003 will 
be announced on Jan. 25, the day before Super Bowl XXXVII 
in San Diego. A minimum of 80 percent of the voting is 
required for election.
 
Enshrinement of the Class of 2003 will take place at the 
Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton on Sunday, Aug. 3.
 
Allen, a six-time Pro Bowler, rushed for 12,243 yards, added 
5,411 yards in receptions, and totaled 145 touchdowns in 16 
years with the Los Angeles Raiders (1982-92) and Kansas City 
Chiefs (1993-97). He rushed for a career-high 1,759 yards in 
1985 and was named the MVP of Super Bowl XVIII, rushing for 
191 yards and two touchdowns in the Raiders' 38-9 rout of 
Washington.
 
Monk played 14 of his 16 seasons with the Washington 
Redskins, and ranks fifth all time with 940 receptions.
 
Lofton is third all time with 14,004 receiving yards on 764 
receptions.
 
Stabler, a four-time Pro Bowler, played 10 of his 15 seasons 
with the Raiders. At the time of his retirement in 1984, his 
59.9 career pass completion percentage was second to Hall of 
Famer Joe Montana.
 
Stram led Kansas City to a Super Bowl title, one other Super 
Bowl appearance, and three AFL championships.
