#1. Chambers present Budget wishes
Agencies/New Delhi

Industry chambers CII, FICCI, Assocham and Phdcci on Monday met finance
ministry officials to submit their suggestions for the Budget for 2003-04.
The chambers put forward their suggestions on both direct and indirect
taxes apart from other reform measures to Finance Secretary S Narayan and
other officials, industry sources said. The informal meeting comes after
Finance Minister Jaswant Singh decided to discontinue the pre-budget
meetings and instead seek suggestions in writing.

#2. Gold at 6-yr high, oil prices up too
REUTERS[ MONDAY, JANUARY 06, 2003 10:36:17 PM ]

SINGAPORE: Gold nudged its highest level for six years on Monday, oil
hovered near a two-year peak and the dollar dipped as signs the US and
Britain were preparing troops for an attack on Iraq kept markets volatile.
But stocks rallied in Asia, led by a surge in Tokyo, as investors set
aside war fears temporarily to focus on hopes for a recovery in the US
economy.

Markets have accommodated the prospect of a US-Iraq conflict and the
strong stimulus being delivered in the US and Europe...should encourage
stronger consumer spending, economic growth and corporate recovery, said
Michael Wilson, chief investment officer at Ausbil Dexia in Australia.

Japanese investors returning from holidays marked by news of preparations
for a possible war on Iraq piled into the safe haven of the bullion
market. That sent gold briefly back to touch $ 353.75 an ounce, a six-year
high set last month, before it eased to around $ 352.55 at 0600 GMT.

The war preparations and the second month of a national strike in
Venezuela kept oil prices on the rise, despite pledges from Saudi Arabia
and Russia that they would keep their crude supplies flowing to world
markets in a bid to calm prices.

US crude was up five cents at $ 33.13 per barrel after rising as high as $
33.33, just short of a two-year high of $ 33.65 hit last week.

The war worries left the dollar struggling against the yen, but traders,
fearful of central bank intervention, were wary about selling the
greenback too heavily. The dollar found some support after Japanese
finance minister Masajuro Shiokawa said there was a global perception the
yen was too strong and its correction would be natural.

War fears are continuing to hurt the dollar. The market is also worried
about the outlook of the US economy, said Takashi Toyahara, forex section
manager at Nomura Securities.

The dollar was quoted at 119.22 yen against 119.66 yen in late New York
trade on Friday. The euro stood at $ 1.0437 against Fridays $ 1.0428.
Despite jitters in other markets, stocks had a mostly upbeat day in Asia.

Japanese shares closed their first session of the year with healthy gains
in the wake of a rise on Wall Street. The Nikkei average rose 1.57 percent
to 8,713.33 in a half-day session following an extended New Year holiday.

Were pretty much on autopilot tracking gains in Wall Street and other
major markets over the New Year break, said Masatoshi Sato, manager of the
equities division at Mizuho Investors Securities.

Benchmark indices closed up 1.37 per cent in Taiwan, 0.85 per cent in
South Korea and 0.65 per cent in Australia. At midday, Hong Kong was up
0.7 per cent, but Singapore had slipped 0.6 per cent.

Strong US manufacturing data last week and President George W Bushs plan
to unveil an economic stimulus package on Tuesday raised hopes for a
recovery in the worlds largest economy.

#3. Bigger gas finds lie on east coast
SANJAY DUTTA, TIMES NEWS NETWORK[ TUESDAY, JANUARY 07, 2003 01:09:15 AM ]

NEW DELHI: The east coast will be the countrys future oil and gas bowl,
with a potential of supplying up to seven billion tonnes of oil and oil
equivalent gas, the countrys caretaker of hydrocarbons assets has said.
The big gas finds reported by Reliance and Cairn off the Andhra coast have
already borne this out. This is just the beginning, director-general of
hydrocarbons Avinash Chandra told TNN.

The two gas finds make up about half a billion tonnes of oil equivalent
gas and at a pessimistic estimate, 6.5 billion tonnes more is waiting to
be tapped, Chandra said. Reliance and Cairn have reported seven tcf
(trillion cubic feet) and one tcf gas finds, respectively, from two blocks
in the Krishna-Godavari basin, which were auctioned in 1999 by the
government as part of a policy to bring private investment in exploration.

The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) too is working in an adjacent
block and has said it is near striking gas. Besides the Andhra coast,
areas south of Rameswaram and southwest of Thiruvananthapuram have been
identified as having huge potential. The Orissa coast too has thrown up a
big potential. The cost of identifying the blocks? Roughly Rs 18 crore.

Starting in 1995,we enlisted the services of European and US satellites
that passed over the areas 20 times a year to identify the potential
blocks deep under the seabed, Chandra said. Chandra said the existing
geographical and seismic data collected over the years by ONGC and Oil
India Ltd showed that the seabed in the east was similar to the oil and
gas producing areas off the coast of Brazil.We needed a new approach and
to go deep under the sea, he said. The satellite mapping was followed with
a two-dimensional seismic survey done from specialised ships.

Chandra said the east coast potential will allow India to strike harder
bargains while importing gas and oil as it will narrow the gap between
supply and demand for fuels. India imports 70 per cent of its requirement
of 105 million tonnes of crude oil and has 65 mmcmd (million cubic metres
per day) of gas against a demand of 150 mmcmd. The government offered 100
blocks identified by the DGH in three rounds of auctioning since 1999. At
least 68 of these were awarded after bids were received for 73 blocks,
Chandra said. Against this, 72 blocks were offered before the auctioning,
bids were received for 13 blocks and only five were awarded. So far, 280
oil and gas fields of various sizes have been found.

ONGC had discovered four major basins  Cambay in Gujarat, Assam, Tripura
and Andhra onshore  before the DGH was set up.

Comment: Energy superpower in the making or just gas? Seriously, this has
stupendous implications for the country, from national security to the
import bill to retail prices. Hopefully, this will be the spark that
lights Indias future.

#4. Golden Quadrilateral project may miss deadline

MUMBAI JAN. 6. The Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) road project is likely to
miss the completion target of December 2004 by an year as over 40 per cent
of the contracts were awarded after July 2001, according to the CRIS-INFAC
report. The usual timeframe for project completion was 30 months and even
if early completion in certain cases was factored in, the GQ project may
still be delayed by a year from the initial schedule, CRIS-INFAC, a
subsidiary of CRISIL, said in its report on roads and highways here today.

Similarly, the north-south and east-west corridors highway project, for
which the funding plan is yet to be approved by the Union Cabinet
Committee, could also be delayed beyond its scheduled completion date of
2007, the CRIS-INFAC said.

The National Highway Authority of India is implementing the project plans
efficiently and "given the magnitude of the task, delays to a certain
extent are reasonable,'' the report said, adding its ability to service
debt and contractual obligation for payment to contractors and annuity is
comfortable.

The progress of rural road development project is slow and greater focus
is needed to increase the momentum, it said. The road projects are likely
to the face shortage of funds for meeting the targets set for the current
five year Plan (2002-07), it said.

"There is a need to encourage greater private sector participation and
develop an active secondary market by securitising the receivables to
ensure broad based participation,'' the report added.  PTI
