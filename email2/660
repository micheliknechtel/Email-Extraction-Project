Greetings Thrifty Friend!

Has this happened to you during the dry winter months?:
You walk across your carpet and reach down to touch your 
computer and ZAP!  The static electricity really gives
you a shock!! This can not only be painful to you, but can 
possibly wreak havoc on your computer and other electronic 
equipment.

Keep on getting your penny's worth!

--TODAY'S THRIFTY TIP:  "SHOCK" TREATMENTS:

During the winter months, when humidity is low, static 
can be a problem, especially with electronic equipment - 
like your computer.  To reduce static you can make your
own inexpensive anti-static spray...  

Combine in a carefully labeled spray bottle (and keep 
out of reach of children, of course):
 1/4 cup liquid fabric softener
 1/4 cup ammonia
 2 cups water 

During winter static season, spray lightly on things that
create shocks, such as rugs, shoes, chairs, etc.  DO NOT
spray directly on your equipment as it could damage some
electronic parts.
