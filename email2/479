<B>A FLYING MACHINE THAT CAN'T</B><BR>
Solo aircraft prototype to go on sale on eBay -- but you can't use it
<P>
<FONT SIZE="1" FACE="geneva,arial,sans-serif">Associated Press</FONT>
<P>SUNNYVALE -- Ever wanted your very own personal flying machine? Now's your chance to get one, but you'll have to shell out some serious cash -- and resist the urge to take it for a spin. 
<p>
The SoloTrek XFV, which made its maiden "flight" in December 2001, is scheduled to go on sale Friday on eBay with a starting bid of about $50,000. Michael Moshier, chief executive of Trek Aerospace, the military-funded company designing the machine, expects the final price in the seven-day auction to exceed $1 million. 
<p>
The prototype has only hovered a few feet off the ground in tests. But it is built to zoom up to 69 mph for 100 miles, carrying a person who weighs up to 180 pounds. Two overhead ducted fans lift the gas-powered machine, and a standing operator steers with a joystick in each hand. 
<p>
"We didn't want to test it higher than we were willing to fall," Moshier said. 
<p>
Engineers at Trek Aerospace retired the prototype last summer to concentrate on a second-generation model with better joysticks and a smoother engine. The Sunnyvale-based company hopes to sell personal flying machines to the military, allowing soldiers to pass over swamps, mine fields and other rough terrain. 
<p>
The company is studying whether consumers would use its craft, which theoretically could ascend to 10,000 feet. 
<p>
The winner of the auction must sign a contract promising not to fly the prototype, to use it for exhibition only. Moshier expects to sell the aluminum and titanium machine to a museum or aviation enthusiast. 
<p>
"It's a different kind of aircraft," he said. "It has a tremendous amount of historical value."
