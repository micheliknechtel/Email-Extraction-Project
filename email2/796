Undergrad and Grad Fellowships for intensive Chinese and Japanese at
Cornell

The FALCON Intensive Chinese and Japanese program at Cornell University
is pleased to announce the availability of undergraduate and graduate
fellowships for the 2003-2004 academic-year and summer-only programs.
FALCON (Full-year Asian Language CONcentration) is a unique accelerated
program offering the longest period of concentrated instruction from the
beginning level available anywhere. Students in the Program spend up to
nine hours a day, five days a week, studying language only, and thus are
able to complete as much as 1800 hours of supervised classroom and
laboratory work in one year.  Practice sections are restricted in size
and are conducted by native speakers.  One lecture daily is conducted in
English to provide necessary analysis and explanation.

The fellowships are competitive, merit-based grants available for all
sessions of FALCON. The amount of the award varies from year to year.
There is a separate application for the fellowships, available from the
FALCON homepage. More information: http://lrc.cornell.edu/falcon/ or
falcon@cornell.edu or 607-255-6457.
