Here are some of your comments. Thanks, even to those who send 
me true hate mail, for reading these articles. Also, I am sorry 
for the typo error the other day. Yes, it should have been 
weight instead of wait.

Just got around to reading your piece on Sharon. 
Unfortunately, being anti-Israel seems to be a prerequisite 
for maintaining one's credentials as a liberal. Certainly, 
Sharon is no dove. You do exaggerate about the numbers at 
Shattila, and your idea that Israel fights the PLO only to 
facilitate annexation of the West Bank is wrongheaded. 

That is like saying that the US fought the Germans so they 
could occupy a slice of Berlin. You also conveniently omit 
the fact that Sharon sends in the tanks when Hamas massacres 
Jews, because it allows them to sabotage the peace process. 
Hamas wants no less than the liquidation of Israel, not peace. 

You also don't mention that Sharon was elected because the 
Israeli's were disgusted with Arafat's rejection of the peace 
settlement that was offered. You allege that Sharon wants to 
drive out the "Palestinians". If he followed the example set 
by Hamas, Israel could have massacred them all by now. The fact 
that Israel has not done so shows that they follow a higher 
moral path than their neighbors. Try to be a little more even-
handed. Otherwise your version of "history" will remain 
forgotten, as it should be.

Hi, Denis; 

Thankfully, today, we can disregard the call-up without fear 
of arrest or raids by federal marshals in the middle of the 
night (at least I hope we don't have to fear that, though the 
Patriot Act and other events seem to indicate otherwise). I 
had to go in, or else, back in 1968 and my family was not 
sufficiently wealthy to find a "legal way" out or fund a trip 
to Canada. President Bush and Vice President Cheney did not 
heed the call-up when their lives and careers were at stake, 
but they most certainly have no problem with calling up a 
younger generation to kill and be killed. 

That's why, like most veterans of my generation, I never voted 
for those bastards and I am actively getting involved with 
current anti-war groups like Move-On.org 
Dan Jacobson - former Hospital Corpsman - served honorably from 
1968 to 1972 
Thank You! Thank You!

  ~*~*~*~*~ KOREA - THE FORGOTTEN WAR on video ~*~*~*~*~

For the millions of servicemen who served in Korea, it can 
never be forgotten. It was one of the most hard-fought and 
bloody wars of all time, over 2,000,000 lives were lost, 
including over 33,000 Americans. Now comes this unprecedented 
video that is undoubtedly one of the best videos ever produced
on Korea. This is the most complete record of the war ever 
made -- from the land, air and sea you will see it all unfold 
before your very eyes. The battle footage is gut-wrenching and
the stories unforgettable. Revisit a little known chapter in 
American History. To order for $19.98 (92 minutes) visit:

I see Eisenhower as one of the most over looked and under-
estimated presidents we had in the 20th Century. He not only 
gave that speech, but started the ball rolling in Civil Rights 
with his use of federalization of the State National Guard of 
Arkansas to enforce the Supreme Court's overturning of the 
"separate but equal" doctrine (declared separate and unequal) 
that states were using to justify segregation of the races. 
How far would the Civil Rights movement have gotten without 
that first step? Present-day Republicans should take a good 
hard look at what they have left behind in their current 
pursuit of gratifying only the wealthy few. 

Where did you EVER get the idea that J E H was "generally 
thought of as the worst public official" we ever had? Taint; 
true, he is regarded as a homo but did a good job for the 
times in which he lived. I also lived in those times. 

Rev. T Stanton
