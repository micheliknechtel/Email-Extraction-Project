Hello Music Lovers!

Last night I went with a friend to see a house that she may 
be buying. This house looked beautiful until we went inside. 
It looked like the Partridge Family had lived there! Orange 
and green flowered wallpaper decorated the walls in the kitchen, 
but the biggest retro flashback was the bathroom wallpaper. 
In BOTH bathrooms the walls were adorned with gold foil 
wallpaper! She looked at me with disgust, but to keep her 
spirit optimistic I said, "Well, we could put a disco ball 
in each bathroom and give them a Studio 54 theme!” :)

~*~ Peace, Love and Music ~*~
