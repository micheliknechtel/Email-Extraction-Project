No rerun rally

Bush's speech may have been today, but the rally was
yesterday. Plus: good news from EMC, and a strike at
GE?

By Andrew Serwer, FORTUNE

Chicago! Chicago! Hey, forget about Catherine Zeta-
Jones, the real star of the Windy City today was
President George W. Bush, who announced his economic
stimulus plan.

Bottom line: It had all pretty much been leaked out.
Market already rallied off this one on Monday, so we
didn't get a rerun on Tuesday. A rosy forecast from
EMC helped techs.

The Dow fell 32 to 8,740, while the Naz climbed 10 to
1,431. Hey watch me, Joseph Campbell (Follow your
bliss, kids, always follow your bliss...), I mean
Andy Serwer, on CNN's "American Morning with Paula
Zahn," and Headline News. Read Loose Change to get my
take on LL Cool J. Here's wazzup:

STOCKYARD As for W.'s plan, a little bigger than we
had thought -- $674 million -- but eliminating the
dividend cut. A vigorous defense was mounted however
by Don Evans and others, claiming the Dem plan was
lame. Now the fun begins as Congress hashes it out.

I really think that W. has done a pretty good job of
preempting the Dems. Who knows if any of these plans
work? Deficit looming larger. Wonder if the
NYT is right that 1) this whole dividend thing
was Charles Schwab's idea; and 2) if it will make
muni bonds less attractive and thereby increase
borrowing costs for states.

Note that states where Dems are more ascendant gets
more from the Dem plan than from W.'s plan.
Coincidence? Me thinks not! Hey, I know! Let's give a
tax break to North Korea! Buy 'em out. We pay Kim
Jong Il money, he leaves and gives us nukes!

Hey, GE's big union is calling a big national strike.
Issues over medical benefits. Hey, Jeff Immelt!
Didn't you come from medical systems? Heard about
this big brouhaha over Coca-Cola and some bottling
plant in India where Coke is suing over the water.
Anyone know about that?

So, EMC FINALLY HAD SOME GOOD NEWS! Outlook is better
and stock climbs 66 cents to $7.46...Have you checked
out Porsche's new SUV, the Cayenne? WHAT a tamale!

GRIM HEADLINE OF THE DAY: "World airline industry
loses $13 billion in 2002." Fly me to the moon...

BEARS Do you know from bears? I know Grizzlies,
blacks, polars, etc, but I'm reading a pretty good
book by Lynn Schooler (a he) called "Blue Bear,"
which he says is a rare kind of bear in lower Alaska
also known as the glacier bear. Only thing is when I
look 'blue bear' up, it looks like the blue bear is
just a phase that a common black bear goes through.
Huh? Help me out on this one!

Loose Change

DEEP BLUE ON STIMULUS PLAN: "They should just give
the big cuts to folks with AGI under 50k. They'll
spend it, generate sales tax $$, and put it back in
the economy -- people like me and you will just sit
on it and put in a college fund. We are too
practical." Great idea, Blue!

READER SAYS: "I read the NY Times on my
commute in and they always refer to the results of
any tax relief as "costing the government $X billion"
rather than "Saving the taxpayers $X billion." Why
the phraseology? I have written countless letters to
the editor to no avail. It's our money in the first
place. Did the quarter I declined to give to the
homeless man on the subway this morning cost him 25
cents? -- Matthew"...

ALSO: "As with you, Yahoo Finance was down for me
yesterday morning. I stepped over to a friend's
(pretty hardcore tech person, mind you) office to see
if they could get to it...they could. So I asked, 'If
we're in the same office, why can you get to it and I
can't?' 'I don't know,' she replied, 'maybe you hit a
bad hub.' Believe or not, she said, 'You should
reboot and see if you hit a good one...'  So I did,
and it worked. It's great working for a technology
giant!' "

AS FOR THE GIANTS, hey it's ALL the ref's fault. Him
and Chris Collingsworth! Can't believe Pitt beat ND!
Is Pitt really any good? Went to a Columbia Lions
hoops game last night. More people went to my high
school games! Heartbreak! Lions lost to Sacred Heart
(Fairfield, CT) on a 3-point shot with two seconds
left! Pioneers had kids from all over -- only two
from CT -- favorite was named Mading Mading from
somewhere in Africa. He didn't play...
