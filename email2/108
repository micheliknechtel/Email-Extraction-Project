"LESSONS LEARNED FROM MISS RUMPHIUS," by Juliana Smith 
===================================================================== 
  
My daughter's favorite book of all time is "Miss Rumphius," by 
Barbara Cooney. The first copy got so worn, that we had to go buy a 
second one. It's a wonderful story, narrated by a little girl named 
Alice about her great-aunt, Miss Alice Rumphius. Alice grows up near 
her grandfather who is a painter and lives by the sea. He regales her 
with stories of faraway places and she helps him with his paintings 
in his workshop. Eventually, she tells her grandfather that when she 
grows up, she too wants to visit faraway places and come back to live 
by the sea. Her grandfather tells her that's all fine and well, but 
she must do one more thing. He tells her, "You must do something to 
make the world more beautiful." Alice grows up and does indeed follow 
in her grandfather's footsteps. She travels to far away places and 
eventually comes home to live by the sea. She remembers her promise 
to her grandfather and decides to plant lupines all around the area 
in which she lives and becomes known as the "Lupine Lady." The 
narrator goes on to say that she too wants to visit faraway places 
and come back to live by the sea. Miss Rumphius reminds her of that 
third thing that she must do, and the book closes with little Alice 
pondering what she can do to make the world more beautiful. 

Last year, my daughter and I planted our first lupines in pots, and 
when the flowers died back, I harvested the seeds to bring to our new 
house. This year, there will be a special section of the garden for 
lupines. The book sends a number of good messages, and I am hoping 
that our tradition of planting lupines will help remind Maddy of 
those messages.  

So what does this have to do with family history? Well, I also see 
some "messages" that we might want to keep in mind as we begin 
another year of researching our ancestry. 


SHARING FAMILY STORIES 

Alice is inspired by the stories her grandfather tells her, so much 
so that she patterns her life around them. Are we sharing our 
stories, and those of our ancestors, with the younger children in our 
families? While they probably aren't going to show much interest in 
our pedigree charts filled with names and dates, children love to 
hear stories. Just as I loved to hear my parents and grandparents 
tell me stories of their life and travels, my daughter is constantly 
asking my husband and I to, "Tell me about when you were little." I 
tell her stories of when I was growing up, stories my mother, father 
and grandparents told me from their youth, and also share stories I 
have learned about our ancestors. 

Facts like birthplace and vital events, migrations, and occupations, 
can be woven into the historical background of the times in which 
they lived to create memorable stories that children can carry with 
them always and pass on to their children. If I have pictures of 
ancestors available, I incorporate them, too. The photographs give a 
face to the people in the stories.   

You may want to put the story down on paper first to get your 
thoughts in order. Don't be afraid to overact a bit. Younger children 
will especially love it and if you make the story exciting for them, 
don't be surprised if you are asked to repeat the story often. This 
will help keep the story fresh in their memory and create a lasting 
bond between you and the child. Who knows what impact these stories 
can have? They just might inspire children to new heights as they 
grow up, just as little Alice was inspired. 


SHARING YOUR HERITAGE 

If storytelling isn't your thing, try sharing your heritage in other 
ways. Miss Rumphius spent time working with her grandfather who was 
an artist, where he would sometimes let her paint in the sky on his 
paintings. Is there a certain talent that has been handed down to you 
through the generations? Drawing or painting, cooking and baking,  
woodworking, writing, knitting or crocheting, quilting, needlework, 
etc.--anything you learned as a child (whether from family or friend) 
can be shared with stories of how you learned that particular craft.  
Both my grandmother and Aunt Chula showed me how to embroider and 
Aunt Lynn showed me how to crochet. These are skills that I am 
starting to teach my daughter. 

It doesn't have to be a difficult task either. As I write this, it is 
not yet Christmas and I spent last weekend making Styrofoam ornaments 
using sequins, with my daughter and her friend. I can remember 
countless Christmases with my sisters and I caught up in this same 
endeavor. Tomorrow, we have a day of cookie baking planned where I 
can share even more stories and traditions with her. 


GOALS 

Just as Miss Rumphius set goals for her life and followed through, we 
should also be setting goals for ourselves, not only in research, but 
in how we can share our research with others in our family--both 
children and grown-ups alike. We have a brand new year ahead of us to 
come up with some ways to share our family history and in the 
tradition of making New Years resolutions, why not resolve to 
undertake a project to share and preserve your family's heritage?  

You could publish your family history in a bound volume or simply 
arrange documents and stories in a binder or scrapbook to give to 
family members. You can make a point to share some oral history with 
younger generations. If it's not possible to do it in person, tape 
your story and send it to them. You could even make it into a 
children's book, complete with pictures of your family. Use your 
talents and gifts to create something that not only tells the family 
story, but is a reflection of you, and it will be cherished for 
generations to come. 

Whatever method you choose, you too will have accomplished that third 
task. What better way to make the world more beautiful than to share 
the gift of your heritage with your family?

"PANNING FOR PANAGIOTIS: AN URBAN CENSUS PROBLEM WITH A TWIST," by 
Michael John Neill 

Before the 1930 every-name census index was completely posted at 
Ancestry.com, one had to rely on traditional search techniques to 
find people in this census. Even now that it is complete for most 
areas, there will still be those names that were difficult to read or 
entered incorrectly on either the census page or the index itself. In 
this week's "Beyond the Index," Michael takes us through a manual 
search in Chicago for one of his ancestors.

NOTE ADDRESSES FOR FUTURE FAMILY HISTORIANS

In my genealogy records, I note where my parents "should" be found in  
upcoming census reports. I have done the same with my husband,  
daughter, and myself. If I'm not around when the 1940 census comes  
out, our daughter will know where to look for her grandparents, and  
when the 1950 census comes out she will know where to look for her  
parents!

PERPETUAL CALENDARS

While preparing a family history calendar (each month the top half 
contains photos corresponding to events that month and the bottom 
half is a perpetual calendar--dates only, no days of the week), I 
decided to use an inexpensive desktop blotter type calendar to record 
the dates concerned. These calendars work well because the boxes are 
a couple of inches long, each, and I can write multiple names on a 
date. 

This helps me see which ancestors and living relatives share special 
dates and is also a good way to proofread your family tree work. Some 
software programs print calendars and chronologies but not always 
with the name and event preferences that I wanted. 

I then transcribe the information into Excel and can easily sort and 
print the information I need to print my calendars. It's a great way 
to educate other family members in a painless way. 

An added bonus is that I have hung the calendar in my home office 
next to the computer and each time I log onto Ancestry.com, I do some 
searches on whoever is featured that day or week on the calendar. I 
probably would never get around to doing some of these searches 
otherwise so it is a good motivation to explore some other lines.

METAL BOX FOR MOBILE FAMILY HISTORY FILES

Hello and Happy New Year to you (Bliadhna Mhath Ur dhut in Scots 
Gaelic) on this snow-covered New England day.

My filing tip is nothing sophisticated but I find it very useful when 
visiting, in person or over the phone, with the increasing number of 
'relatives' I'm finding here in the northeast.

I purchased a Brinks Home Security light metal locking box with a 
handle on the top (WalMart, approx. $12), about the size of a large 
briefcase. It was made to hold hanging folders. Each folder has the 
name of an individual from my great-grandparents list of children, 
and also each individual folder contains copies of all the 
information I have on that particular person. I call it my "work-in-
progress."

When I get together with the growing list of descendants who are also 
working on this same line I have my documents with me for reference 
and their perusal. I can then add information from them to the 
folder, to be worked into that particular individual's tapestry when 
I have the time.

It's simple and it works for me. I find it convenient to have this 
with me when visiting, rather than carrying notebooks, loose files 
and reams of unrelated, but cumbersome papers.

The first folder is of my great-grandparents as a couple, the next 
are of them as individuals, and the remainder of the folders are for 
their children in order of birth. Any new scrap I get is immediately 
added to the proper folder. The last folder is for miscellaneous, but 
related, information.  

There is room in the back for extra paper, forms and blank charts,

RINSE FOR COLORFAST FABRIC

In regard to the tip about making sure your ink is colorfast when 
printing on fabric there is a method to make your own colorfast 
fabric.
(http://www.ancestry.com/rd/prodredir.asp?sourceid=831&key=A671302 )

You can purchase a liquid called Bubble Jet Set 2000 and a liquid 
called Bubble Jet Rinse with complete directions from the 
manufacturer, and it works. I've used it.

You can find these products on the Web at 
http://www.softexpressions.com The minimum purchase amount will be 
enough for a great deal of fabric.

CLIPPING OF THE WEEK

From "The Titusville Morning Herald" (Titusville, PA), 6 January 
1873, page 1: 

GRANT'S COMMON SENSE--HIS DISREGARD OF CEREMONY 

A Washington letter to the Chicago "Inter-Ocean" says: 

What would have been thought, in old times, if General Grant's 
throwing to the winds all forms and ceremonies, driving his own horse 
without an attendant. He calls and visits where, when and whom he 
pleases, walks down the avenue; if he gets tired takes a street car, 
stops at the shops if he has an errand to do, or stands in the door 
of a bank and takes a view of the crowd passing--as I say him do not 
long since. All this is very dreadful to the old school devotees, and 
the criticisms upon it are numerous and severe. 

The President goes to the Capitol and talks familiarly with Senators 
and members about public affairs. This too is the subject of 
animadversion by his enemies. His interest in legislation is called 
by them a desire to push pet schemes, and the opposition goes into 
convulsions over the tendency of the Executive to usurpation. 

No President has ever possessed the regularity and singular 
independence that characterize General Grant in these particulars.  
There is a strong element of common sense too rare by far among men 
in this man's nature, and he represents a new order of administrative 
minds, and naturally affiliates with these men who develop great 
enterprises, who build railroads, open new territory, make remarkable 
discoveries, and add to the greatness and glory of the Republic.

From the "Nevada State Journal" Reno, NV, 7 January 1871, page 3:

A FEROCIOUS TURKEY

The holidays are past and gone and so are most of the turkeys which 
were displayed for sale, but I know of one big bird which was not 
displayed for sale, and is not gone either. Certain festive admirers 
of turkey, dwelling within the precincts of this lop-sided city, had 
kept a wistful eye upon the fine big bird in question which the 
proprietor kept in a nice cage in his back yard, feeding and 
fattening him as they thought for Christmas. So just a night or two 
before that gay holiday, Sam., the most skillful turkey operator of 
them, crept through the fence into that backyard. The night was dark 
and bitter cold, but our undaunted friend Sam. crawled straight for 
that caged turkey. He cautiously ripped off a couple of slats, 
reached in carefully, got the proper grip on both legs and neck, and 
bore away with the prize in triumph. But now came the tug of war.  
The infuriated fowl was unexpectedly active and powerful and made it 
mighty hot for Sam., scratching, digging and tearing with his 
confounded claws at a fearful rate. "There boys," says Sam. as he got 
back home. "I've got him, but blow me if he isn't a little the 
meanest derned old gobbler I ever tackled, and cuss me if I believe 
he is so very fat either. Hey! hells! what the devil--well I'm blest 
if here isn't a sell!" The boys were all inspecting the prize and 
such laughing as there was at Sam's expense nobody ever heard before.  
It was no turkey at all, but simply a big eagle which the proprietor 
had caged up for a curiosity. Poor Sam. gazed sadly upon his 
scratched and bleeding hands and torn clothing for a moment, and then 
made a desperate sortie upon the defiant bird, conquered and lugged 
it back to its cage. If you want to get a fight out of Sam. now, all 
you have to do is talk turkey at him.
