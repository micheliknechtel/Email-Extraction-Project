Rett Syndrome: A New Understanding Of Neurological Disorders

pivotal research, along with lobbying efforts by actress Julia
Roberts, has brought this once obscure disease to the political
and scientific forefront.

Women And Heart Disease
For years, heart disease was considered a man's disease. But 
postmenopausal women are just as likely to develop heart disease as men. 
When heart attacks do occur, they are more likely to be fatal in women. 
Unfortunately, many women remain unaware of the extent of their risk.

you how.

African-Americans And Depression
Anyone can have clinical depression. However, cultural background plays
a large role in how the symptoms of depression are reported and interpreted, 
and consequently, if and how clinical depression is recognized and treated.
