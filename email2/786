All Anti-Hindutva Political Parties Should Be Banned, Says Togadia

Pune:  At the end of a three-day brainstorming session in Pune on Sunday, a=
 belligerent Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leadership slammed the secular par=
ties while coming out strongly in support of its stated policies of Hindu r=
ashtra and jehadi terrorists.

The VHP international secretary Praveen Togadia demanded the government to =
ban all secular and anti-Hindutva political parties, and held out a clear w=
arning to the minorities: Gujarat riots happened because of Godhra and if t=
he incident is repeated, riots will happen again.

Addressing a rally, dubbed a "dharma sabha", Togadia said, "There are three=
 Mohammad Ghaznis here. The first are the jehadi terrorists, the second are=
 the secularists and the third are the non-Hindu parties".

Holding the Godhra carnage directly responsible for the Gujarat riots, Toga=
dia said if such events happened again, incidents like Naroda Patiya would =
be repeated. Without naming the Congress, Togadia said, "If any party wishe=
s to rule India, it has to accept the concept of Hindu rashtra".

He said politics in India had to be based on Hinduism and called for all Hi=
ndus to be organised into an army to erase the existence of Pakistan and to=
 restore an "Akhand Bharat" (unified India).

Matching the hostile tenor, VHP president Ashok Singhal asked Muslims to gi=
ve up their claims to Kashi and Mathura. He said the VHP would build huge t=
emples in both the cities. Singhal said the VHP would pressurize the Centre=
 to hand over the disputed site in Ayodhya to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, a t=
rust responsible for the building of Ram Temple. He said it (VHP) would, if=
 necessary, go for a showdown with the Centre on the issue of temple constr=
uction in Ayodhya and said it would fully abide by the decision of Hindu `s=
ants'.=20

His remarks came after the VHP asked the Centre to hand over the disputed t=
emple site in Ayodhya to the Ram Janambhoomi Trust before February-end.=20

India Urged to Quit Assam

Guwahati: The United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) has demanded India to=
 end its colonial rule in Assam, holding its colonial policies responsible =
for the death of at least 35 tea plantation workers in Assam. The ULFA spok=
esman alleged that the both public and private companies operating in Assam=
 are exploiting the people of Assam in connivance with the Indian governmen=
t. Assam accounts for 55 percent of the country's total annual tea producti=
on of 823 million kilograms but food and medicines are a distant dream for =
the people with most of the families literally starving, said the spokesman=
.

35 workers on tea plantation had died of starvation and disease last week s=
ince employers; The Hindustan Tea Company, locked them out six months ago o=
ver a wage dispute at the Hatticherra and Subong tea gardens in the souther=
n Cachar district, 310 km from Guwahati.

"Up to 35 workers have died for hunger and disease since June with no sourc=
e of income, while hundreds of others, including woman and children, are vi=
rtually staring at death," said workers' representative K. Dutta Choudhury.

K. Dutta Choudhury who is the president of the Barak Valley Chah Mazdoor Sa=
ngh, the umbrella body for workers of 160 tea gardens in southern Assam fur=
ther told that at least three children died earlier this week due to starva=
tion and poor healthcare facilities. Disease has stuck most of the children=
 in most of the tea gardens in Assam with no healthcare facilities availabl=
e. Hundreds of children and elderly people in these gardens are passing ago=
nizing days with no warm clothes or woolens to keep away the winter chill, =
he added.

The two gardens, owned by a British company until 1970, had workforce of ab=
out 5,000 and produced an estimated 800,000 kg of tea annually before the l=
ockout. The Assam government did not take notice of the illegal lockout at =
the two gardens and even now after the incident it has not taken any legal =
action against the proprietors as yet.

NHRC Worries about Growing Religious Intolerance

      NEW DELHI: The Chairman of the Indian human rights commission, The Na=
tional Commission for Human Rights (NHRC), J S Verma has expressed "serious=
 concern" over the "increasing religious and social intolerance " in the co=
untry, saying it was a very "disturbing and an unhealthy trend".

"I personally feel that continuing intolerance for religion is a major worr=
y. It is also in violation of our democratic rights provided to the citizen=
s under the country's Constitution," Verma said.

 "Any body who does not go with your view of thinking cannot be called anti=
-national". With out naming the BJP and its affiliates, he said any particu=
lar person or group does not have a monopoly of nationality and it is distu=
rbing and a very unhealthy trend.

People should appreciate the diversity in our country and should respect th=
e religion and culture followed by fellow citizens, the chairman said, addi=
ng that past experiences, where the country deviated from democratic norms,=
 have been very distasteful and "we should not forget that."

Asked if he was referring to Gujarat where glaring incidents of religious i=
ntolerance took place, Verma said that the NHRC has already unveiled the Mo=
di government's involvement in the anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat state.=20

NSCN Accused of Violating the Ceasefire

     Guwahati: Security forces accused the National Socialist Council of Na=
galand of jeopardizing peace talks by violating a ceasefire in Nagaland.=20

"In a blatant violation of the ceasefire, the Isak-Muivah faction of the Na=
tional Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) had attacked one of our patrol =
parties killing a soldier," said a statement from the Assam Rifles.=20

"There were several instances when NSCN cadres were spotted with arms outsi=
de their designated camps."=20

Led by guerrilla leaders Thuingaleng Muivah and Isak Chishi Swu, the NSCN e=
ntered into a ceasefire with the government in August 1997 to bring an end =
to more than 55 years of violent insurgency.=20

Despite the ceasefire, the NSCN continues to hold on to a substantial cache=
 of weapons, and its armed cadres reside in seven designated camps.=20

The NSCN, fighting for an independent tribal homeland, has held several rou=
nds of peace talks with the government in various southeast Asian cities.=20

The latest round of talks between the NSCN leadership and the government's =
chief interlocutor K Padmanabhaiah was held in Italy in November.=20

Nagaland chief minister S C Jamir also accused the NSCN of violating the tr=
uce. "Despite the ceasefire, the NSCN has looted bus passengers, fired on s=
ecurity forces, besides moving out of their camps with weapons, although th=
ey are not supposed to do so under the ceasefire agreement," the chief mini=
ster said.=20

On the other hand the NSCN spokesman has counter accused the Indian securit=
y forces of violating the agreement by still carrying out covert operations=
 against the organisation as well as committing constant human rights abuse=
s against the people of Nagaland. He also threatened to abrogate the agreem=
ent if India continues to violate the bilateral agreement.=20

New Delhi lifted a ban on the NSCN in November, 12 years after the organisa=
tion was declared illegal. The accusations of ceasefire violations come at =
a time when the two top NSCN leaders, who have been in exile for the past d=
ecade, are expected to arrive in India for crucial talks next month
