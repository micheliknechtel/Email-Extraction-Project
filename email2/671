Hi!  I'm Lizzy!!  and I'm not Martha!!!

My personal family fan club knows that I am a cook. I've got 
just about every pot and pan known to man-even a zabaglione 
pot! So when one of my darlings finds a new one to add to my 
kitchen you can just about star the date on your calendar.

So when this new pan arrived under my tree-well, I was tickled 
pink! I got a searing pan. What makes a searing pan--you might 
ask. I am here to illuminate and tell you what the excitement 
is all about.

First of all-what is a searing pan? It looks like a large 
(12") straight -sided frying pan BUT the side is only 1" 
high. Imagine your chicken fryer only less than half as 
high. Got it?

OK, now that what the pan looks like is settled--What is sear-
ing and why it's such a special pan?

Searing is browning meat quickly by subjecting it to VERY high 
heat. Now you can do this in a skillet (my Christmas present), 
under the broiler, or in a very hot oven.

The goal is to seal in the meat's juices. You will sometimes 
find the word seal used in recipes in place of searing. Both 
mean the same thing.

The shallow pan allows the humidity created by the high heat to 
escape instead of being held near the me. You can use a pan you 
have but the searing pan is designed for a drier heat, hence a 
hotter, faster seal. 

Searing generates wonderfully flavorful bits on the pan, (re-
ferred in cooking books as the "fond"), and a great crust on 
the meat. These bits are then combined with the juices of the 
meat and a wide variety of possible liquids and flavorings.

For those of you who are interested in the chemistry of cooking, 
searing involves a chemical reaction known as the Maillard rea-
ction. This describes how flavorful compounds are produced when 
amino acids and sugars combine in the presence of heat.

Searing properly is easy as long as you remember some key 
points:

* Bring the meat to room temperature, if at all possible.

* Pat the meat dry.

* Choose a stainless steel pan that is large enough to hold 
the meat comfortably. Do not use a nonstick pan. Also, do not 
use an aluminum pan.

* Add a thin layer of oil or butter/oil combination (butter 
alone will burn), to a very hot pan. You can tell the temp-
erature is right as the oil should be shimmering, but not 
smoking.

* Do not salt the meat until after you have turned it, (salt 
brings out moisture and if you presalt, you will end up 
steaming it).

* If you are searing small pieces, e.g. chicken or sirloin 
tips, do not crowd them. If they are crowded, the meat will 
steam.

* Do not turn the meat until after the crust has fully for-
med on the pan side. It is easy to tell if the crust has 
formed, as the meat will no longer stick to the pan.

Well...Sear you later!  (I'm so happy that you tolerate my 
puns)
