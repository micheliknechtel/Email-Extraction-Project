Thought for the Week: Resolved: Better Reading

Dear Readers, 

Welcome to 2003! It has been almost three weeks since the last
BestEzines went out, and we're full to bursting with good things
to read.

However, I'd also like to ask a favor. BestEzines has always sorted
through the email newsletters floating out there on the Internet
and produced a few each issue that we think you'd like to read.

Now is your chance to tell us what kinds of ezines you would
like to read. Serious or silly? Family or fishing? Sports or
business? All of the above? If it's available, and it's free, 
we'll track it down and report on it here.

Naturally, with almost 13,000 readers on our mailing list, we
can't find an ezine for each person. But, you'll find BestEzines
will be better at finding the material you want to read.

To voice your opinion, send email to our comments box:
mailto:feedback@bestezines.com 

Thanks!

Janet Roberts
Editor

                    This Week's Selections
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Arts/Entertainment: Writer's Almanac Daily

Do you listen to public radio in the United States or Canada? If 
you're lucky, your station subscribes to Minnesota Public Radio's
5-minute program Writer's Almanac Daily, hosted by the one and 
only Garrison Keillor. 

If you don't live within earshot of this daily broadcasting gem,
you can still enjoy a thoughtful five-minute break with this
newsletter, an attractive transcript of each broadcast. All you're
missing is Keillor's distinctive voice.

Each daily missive includes a brief literary work, such as a poem
or essay, birthdays of noted writers, artists and entertainers and 
a more detailed biography of one notable personage. Each one also
ends with Keillor's benediction for writers: "Be well, do good work
and keep in touch."

And, actually, you can hear the broadcast, if you have sound 
capability on your computer. Each newsletter also includes a link
to the broadcast in RealAudio. So, you'll never have to miss a
broadcast.

Inspirational: LifeTimes Catholic Ezine

Depending on your point of view, this is either a terribly 
challenging time to be a Catholic or a great opportunity to bring
new life and perspective to the Christian world's largest denomination. 

LifeTimes Catholic Ezine seeks to connect Catholics and their faith 
today without staking out positions on difficult political or 
dogmatic issues. Each issue features a mini-homily from Editor 
Brandon Jubar, a layman who thinks long and hard about incorporating 
faith into daily life, as well as a digest of current stories on the 
ParishWebmaster.com Web site and some family-friendly Web sites. 

Not everything in the newsletter relates exclusively to Catholics, 
although if there's something unusual out there - such as a link 
to the site that explains how to say the Rosary properly - Brandon 
will find it. 

To subscribe, visit the Web site and fill in the blank at the
top: http://www.ParishWebmaster.com/       

                         **********

Business: PowerPoint and Beyond

If your job includes making regular presentations, whether to a
small group at work or an auditorium full of strangers, you 
probably have used MS PowerPoint or a similar program to create 
more interesting visuals. 

As with any business tool, there is a right way and a wrong way 
to use the technology. This monthly newsletter will help you find 
the right ways, whether with PowerPoint specifically or your overall 
presentation. 

You'll get tips specifically designed to help you solve or avoid 
problems with your software as well as more general advice on 
speaking and presentation skills. 

To subscribe, send email with subscribe in the subject line to

Sports: Endurance Sports Update

Whether you're a marathon runner, mountain climber, long-distance
biker or multi-sport hardbody, this practical monthly newsletter
will keep you informed of new developments, equipment news,
training advice, useful resources and reader opinions.

In some issues, editor and veteran reporter James Raia covers 
events, while in others, he explores current controversies, such as 
whether marathons should accommodate slower runners or close the 
route after only a few hours. 

The writing is brisk but friendly, with a little commentary thrown 
in to spice things up. Read this while you're cooling down from your 
latest workout, and remember to dry off the seat when you finish.
