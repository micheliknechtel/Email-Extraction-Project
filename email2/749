Today's joke: Desi Hell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A desi dies and goes to hell. There he finds that there is a different 
hell for each country. He goes first to the German hell and asks What do 
they do here?" 

He is told "First they put you in an electric chair for an hour. Then 
they lay you on a bed of nails for another hour. Then the German devil 
comes in and whips you for the rest of the day." 

The man does not like the sound of that at all, so he moves on. He 
checks out the USA hell as well as the Russian hell and many more. He 
discovers that they are all more or less the same as the German hell. 

Then he comes to the Indian hell and finds that there is a very long 
line of people waiting to get in. Amazed he asks, "What do they do 
here?" 

He is told "First they put you in an electric chair for an hour. Then 
they lay you on a bed of nails for another hour. Then the Indian devil 
comes in and whips you for the rest of the day." 

"But that is exactly the same as all the other hells - why are there so 
many people waiting to get in? 

"Because there is never any electricity, so the electric chair does not 
work, someone stole all the nails, and the devil used to be a public 
servant, so he comes in, punches his time-card and then goes back 
home..."
