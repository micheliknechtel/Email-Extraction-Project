Greetings Jam-Heads!

Just a friendly note from your friends at the Pearl 
Jam Vault ( http://pjvault.com ) to let you know we'll 
be updating the band's 2003 tour stats as the tour 
progresses.  Click below for the current stats through 
the first few shows. (Special thanks to Jonathan Cohen!)
http://pjvault.com/stats2003.html

Lastly, we've corralled some press from some Australian 
newspapers ( http://pjvault.com/news.html ) and have 
added some recent "You Know You're A Jam-Head" gems  
( http://pjvault.com/jamhead.html ) from you, Jam-Head 
nation.

John
