HistoryDaily.com - An Entertaining Look Back  
By Charles Smith and Trevor Smith

January 7, 2003 on this day:

In 1927 the first commercial telephone service across the
Atlantic Ocean became available. The signal was transmitted via
radio waves and calls could only be made between New York and
London. The system was built by AT&T. Not surprisingly, the sound
quality was poor and the weather often interfered. The calls were
also very expensive, costing seventy-five dollars for a
five-minute conversation. Despite these limitations, the system
was a success. Thirty-one calls were placed on the first day.

If you had the premium version you would read more about this
topic. Plus you would read about the first American combat jet.
It was a pretty slick plane despite the fact that it was
primitive by today's standards. There is more in there too!

Also on this day:

In 1807, as a war measure against French Emperor Napoleon
Bonaparte, the British announced a blockade of Continental
Europe.

In 1785 Frenchman Jean-Pierre Blanchard and American Dr. John
Jeffries became the first men to cross the English Channel in a
balloon. It was filled with hydrogen.

Yesterday's question and answer:

This was a hard one and I received every answer imaginable. Maybe
I should have given you a few more hints. The question was
"Senator Robert Taft compared lending military equipment to this
substance." The substance is chewing gum, because "once you lend
it you don't want it back." Mike Calkins sent me the answer
first.

In the premium version I tell what percentage of the Lend Lease
war material Britain returned. Are you curious? For just ten
bucks I will give you a whole year of neat history.

Today's Question: During which presidential administration was
the first telephone installed?
