Dear Friend of Borders,

While going through photo albums over the holidays, I stumbled=20
across a column clipped from my hometown newspaper, dated=20
January 1, 1995. There were photos of several town citizens=20
with captions declaring each person's New Year's resolution. A=20
local real-estate agent wanted to lose 50 pounds by summer. A=20
high-school teacher wanted to spend more time with his own=20
kids. And then there's me, grinning cheekily off the page,=20
announcing, "I don't make resolutions. I'm perfect."=20

That statement was only half true. I had given up on New Year's=20
resolutions not because I honestly believed I was perfect, but=20
because, in my experience, they never worked. Now, a few years=20
older and maybe a little bit wiser, I have learned that a=20
lasting lifestyle overhaul is best built from small,=20
sustainable changes. Take dieting, for instance. I can't live=20
on cabbage soup. I can, however, forego all kinds of packaged=20
grocery-store treats. I'm trying to focus on being well, not=20
skinny. I've been studying THE GOOD FAT COOKBOOK, in which Fran=20
McCullough asks the sensible question, "If we've been eating=20
low-fat for 30 years, why haven't we gotten healthier?" She=20
doesn't suggest easy answers. Instead, she thoroughly explains=20
the difference between bad fats and essential fats, and she=20
offers recipes rich in the latter, like this yummy SALMON CHOWDER.=20

So, what are your goals for 2003? Do you want to get fit? Maybe=20
you're resolved to get your financial house in order. Perhaps=20
you'd like to learn to be happier. Whatever your goals for the=20
year ahead, you'll find a wealth of resources for smart,=20
meaningful change in our NEW YEAR, NEW YOU boutique.=20

And remember: Take it easy.=20

Happy New Year,=20
Jessica Jernigan=20

A NEW YORK STORY -- In Pete Hamill's FOREVER,=20
Cormac O'Connor arrives in New York from Ireland in 1740=20
and is granted the gift of immortality, provided he never leaves=20
the island of Manhattan. Over the next two-and-a-half centuries,=20
O'Connor watches New York evolve from a wilderness into the=20
city that never sleeps. As he relates in this ESSAY, Hamill=20
finished his latest novel September 10, 2001. One day later,=20
watching his city blow apart, he realized he would have to rewrite=20
the end of the book. We meet the boy Cormac in this EXCERPT.=20

URBAN GRIT -- In this Q&A, Richard Price explains that his=20
latest novel, SAMARITAN, is "about the Haves reaching out=20
without really understanding what the Have Nots are all about,=20
and the trickiness of trying to connect in a real and=20
meaningful way across the lines of race and class." It's also a=20
riveting mystery, a literary blend of psychological suspense=20
and police procedural. Protagonist Ray Mitchell tells his=20
teenage daughter a story in this EXCERPT.=20

ART AND LIFE -- Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi's sex=20
made her a novelty, a fact that created sensational demand for=20
her work. But her sex also made her vulnerable to criticism,=20
and it prevented her from earning the reputation and lasting=20
legacy afforded to her male peers. In THE PASSION OF ARTEMISIA
(now available in paperback), Susan Vreeland (GIRL IN HYACINTH=20
BLUE) brings this once-lost artist to light. The author talks=20
about her heroine in this INTERVIEW, and she introduces her in=20
this EXCERPT.=20

PENGUIN CLASSICS -- Wouldn't it be nice to say you've read=20
MOBY-DICK and actually mean it? This year, while you're=20

view, and an almost inborn understanding of her place on the=20
ranch. The women's liberation movement of the '60s sparked her=20
young imagination, but Blunt banked that fire when she took on=20
the roles of wife and mother. Blunt tells the story of her=20
girlhood, her wifehood, and her decision to strike out on her=20
own. She describes the life of ranch women in an ESSAY, while=20
this EXCERPT conveys the quality of her prose: fierce and wry,=20
haunting and proud.=20

Dear Friend of Borders,<BR>
<BR>
While going through photo albums over the holidays, I stumbled across a col=
umn clipped from my hometown newspaper, dated January 1, 1995. There were p=
hotos of several town citizens with captions declaring each person's New Ye=
ar's resolution. A local real-estate agent wanted to lose 50 pounds by summ=
er. A high-school teacher wanted to spend more time with his own kids. And =
then there's me, grinning cheekily off the page, announcing, "I don't make =
resolutions. I'm perfect." <BR>
<BR>
That statement was only half true. I had given up on New Year's<A HREF=3D"h=

> resolutions not because I honestly believed I was perfect, but because, i=
n my experience, they never worked. Now, a few years older and maybe a litt=
le bit wiser, I have learned that a lasting lifestyle overhaul is best buil=
t from small, sustainable changes. Take dieting, for instance. I can't live=
 on cabbage soup. I can, however, forego all kinds of packaged grocery-stor=
e treats. I'm trying to focus on being well, not skinny. I've been studying=

n, "If we've been eating low-fat for 30 years, why haven't we gotten health=

e difference between bad fats and essential fats, and she offers recipes ri=
