___| THE WEEK IN REVIEW |________________________________

By Ann C. Logue

Although acquirers announced only nine noteworthy deals last week, those deals reflected relatively high levels of spending. Buyers are committing cash to those properties that enhance their long-term strategy. The week's spending was led by USA Interactive's $734 million stock acquisition of LendingTree, which offers online mortgage services. USA Interactive has been actively consolidating online entertainment and travel companies. This deal is its first in the real estate and financial services sector, but the company signaled that more such acquisitions are likely to follow. The real estate sector had been consolidated by Homestore.com, an online affiliate of the National Association of Realtors. Homestore has had problems integrating some of its properties and may be vulnerable to competition - at least in the mind of USA Interactive's Chairman & CEO, Barry Diller.

In other sectors, we saw a continuation of recent ASP consolidation activity. Alpha Virtual, which develops collaboration services, acquired workflow manager EssTec for $23 million in stock. JDA Software, which sells software for retail supply chain management, acquired Vista, which offers a Web-based collaborative commerce module. And Aurum Technology, a provider of technology to financial services companies, acquired Computer Consultants, an ASP for credit unions. 

===== FREE REPORT: M&A TRENDS IN SECURITY SOFTWARE ======

The security market has seen accelerating consolidation, generally aimed toward delivering integrated solutions. Firewall/VPN Vendors are seeking complementary IDS technologies (SYMC/Recourse; NSCN/OneSecure) and Access and Identity Management are beginning to combine (IBM/Access360). We expect consolidation to continue in 2003, as the security landscape is still fairly fragmented. Smaller firms will find it increasingly difficult to make enterprise-class sales, and will be forced to sell to strategic acquirers. Our report charts trends in this sector.
