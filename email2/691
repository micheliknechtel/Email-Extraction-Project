In depth:

* Push comes to shove in Washington (Viewpoint)
­- Do you believe that independent ISPs in the U.S. need continuing access to the networks built by government-sanctioned monopolies and the public's right-of-way access? Not any more, say envious, spiteful telephone companies who can't see their own doom coming. Read my viewpoint at
http://www.ispcon.com/SNEditorial/sn_detail.asp?ID=160

* Sharing files anywhere (NetSense TalkRadio)
- Before FTP, before email, there was Mark Eppley's LapLink. Now Laplink Everywhere is an Internet service. Listen to my interview with Eppley at
http://www.ispcon.com/SNEditorial/sn_detail.asp?cat=2&ID=156

* Looking for new services? Look to new software (Viewpoint)
- With the development of Mitch Kapor’s open-source Personal Information Manager named Chandler, there are some new ways for ISPs to become ASPs and differentiate themselves from the competition by serving their customers better. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg; even bigger change is coming to software, and that means lots of new services. Read my viewpoint at
http://www.ispcon.com/SNEditorial/sn_detail.asp?cat=4&ID=161

* Outsourcing vendor selection (White paper)
- Outsourcing skeptics claim that an outsider cannot give the same concentration and focus as the in-house team. It therefore becomes imperative to do thorough vendor scrutiny before entrusting critical technical roadmaps and confidential information on him. Read the Hughes Software Systems white paper at

* Clueful-News in transition
- This, the 50th Clueful-News newsletter, is the last to be hosted by Lyris. Unsubscribe features will not work after today. If you wish to unsubscribe or change your email address after today, please send me an email at smace@ispcon.com.
