[1] New Teaching & Learning Technologies Center

The Teaching and Learning Technologies Lab (TLTL), a University
Information Technology Services and Instructional Support Services
partnership, has a new name: Teaching and Learning Technologies
Center (TLTC) - and a second facility to complement the existing one
in Ballantine 307. A 3,000 square-foot facility, located on the third
floor of the Main Library's undergraduate tower, opened its doors at
the beginning of the year.

The new center is a partnership of UITS, the Office of Academic
Affairs, and the IUB Libraries. It does not replace the Ballantine
facility, but rather offers the same services in a location more
convenient for instructors on the north side of campus.

Faculty and staff are invited to attend a daylong open house at both
the Main Library and Ballantine Hall locations on Monday, January 27,
with a dedication for the new Main Library location at 3pm, followed
by a reception.

For more on the TLTC, see: http://www.indiana.edu/~tltc/

-----------------------------------
[2] Students: Showcase your project

This year's "Making IT Happen!", a day-long information technology
(IT) fair highlighting support, resources, and innovations in IT at
IU, will feature student showcases of academic projects that use IT:

  * IUB's 2003 "Making IT Happen!"
  * Thursday, February 20
  * Indiana Memorial Union

Entry requirements:

  * Any academic area
  * Completed in the past year
  * Used IT resources for research, compilation, analysis, etc.

For more information and to submit your student project, go to:

   http://www.indiana.edu/~mith/iub/

-----------------------
[3] Information Commons

The renovation of the first floor of the West Tower of the IUB Main
Library began on January 6, 2003. The project, to be completed over
the summer, will transform the 27,000-square-foot space into the
Information Commons, a state-of-the-art, highly integrated technology
and information center that will foster student learning and enhance
faculty research and teaching opportunities.

A joint effort between the Indiana University Libraries and
University Information Technology Services, the Information Commons
will provide space for collaborative learning. In addition to housing
valuable print collections, the Commons will be a centrally located
place for students and faculty to interact; to attend technology
training classes; and to have full-service access to technology,
technologists, and reference librarians.

For a directory of services relocated during construction and for
more information about the Information Commons, please see:

   http://ic.indiana.edu/

---------------------------------
[4] Windows XP coming to the STCs

This summer, all Windows Student Technology Centers (STCs) will be
upgraded to Windows XP.

To provide ample time to test application compatibility with Windows
XP, beginning 1 February 2003, the STC in the Indiana Memorial Union,
room 089, will be upgraded to Windows XP. This pilot location will
include the full suite of standard Windows applications currently
found in the STCs.

Faculty who rely on departmentally sponsored applications in the STCs
are encouraged to visit IMU 089 during the spring semester to test
their Windows applications with Windows XP.

For more information, go to:

   http://stcweb.uits.indiana.edu

Questions? Send e-mail to stcsw@indiana.edu.

-----------------------------------------------
[5] Faculty: Request your summer software early

If you depend upon departmentally sponsored software for instruction
during the summer, be sure to get your requests to the STCs before
February 15 to ensure a timely deployment. Late requests will be
processed on a first-come basis.

To avoid delays, please provide media and proof of licensing as soon
as possible after you make your request. Keep in mind that all
requests for new applications or for upgrades to existing
applications will be deployed under Windows XP. To submit a request,
go to the "Request for Services Form" at:

   http://stcweb.uits.indiana.edu/apps/rfs/rfs.cfm

For more information, look under "Request for Services" at:

   http://stcweb.uits.indiana.edu/

Questions? Send e-mail to stcsw@indiana.edu.

--------------------------------------------
[6] Roll over unused STC printing allotment

Students: If you have any unused printing allotment from fall
semester, you have until mid-February to request a rollover of up to
300 pages to your spring balance. To check your printing allotment or
apply your unused fall allotment to your spring balance, go to:

   http://stcweb.uits.indiana.edu/print/quota/userquota.cfm

Questions? Send e-mail to stcprint@indiana.edu.

-------------------------
[7] Mypage for your pages

IU's personal home page service, Php, is now known as Mypage. This
change was made to reduce confusion with PHP, a Web page scripting
language, while at the same time creating a more intuitive, easy-to-
remember URL. You'll still create and edit your home pages on Steel;
the only difference is the URL at which you access them.  To access
your Web pages, go to:

   http://mypage.iu.edu/~username/

Replace "username" with your own username.

For more information, see:

   http://kb.indiana.edu/data/alcr.html

------------------------------------------
[8] New this spring from IU's IT Training

IT Training & Education's spring schedule is now online and includes
workshops on more than 70 topics. You can see the full listing of
STEPS, PROSTEPS and Infoshare workshop descriptions, spring schedules
and registration options on the IT Training Web site.

This spring, IT Training will be offering 6 new Infoshares on GIS
topics, Polycom and Advanced Cascading Style Sheets. Also new this
spring, IT Training Online (http://ittraining.iu.edu/online) is
making more than 600 self-study IT courses available to all members
of the IU community. As the new front door to courses from NETg, IT
Training Online makes it easier for you to find the self-study IT
training resource you need - whether on the Web or on CD.

For all workshop descriptions, schedules, registration options and
online training resources, visit the IT Training & Education Web
site:

    http://ittraining.iu.edu

You can also pick up a paper catalog at the Support Center (IMU
M084), in any Student Technology Center, or by contacting the IT
Training & Education office (855-7383; ittraining@indiana.edu).

------------------------------
[9] New online IU Address Book

A new version of the online address book that is accessible from off-
campus is now available at:

   http://people.iu.edu/

In October, access to the IU Web-based address book had been
restricted to University network addresses, including on-campus
network connections, campus dial-up services, and campus VPN
services. This restriction addressed technical security concerns.
This new, temporary version enables off-campus access until a final
version is released in March as part of the Global Directory Service.
Previous restrictions on a maximum of 50 returns and rules for
student data suppression still apply.
