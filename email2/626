                Air Pollution May Alter Genes

Six years ago, scientists found that herring gulls living near=20
steel mills around the harbour in Hamilton, Ontario, tended to=20
have high DNA mutation rates. These mutations were then=20
transferred to the next generation of gulls, increasing the=20
offspring's chances of developing genetic diseases like cancer=20
and birth defects. Researchers suspected at the time that air=20
pollution was causing the mutations, but they couldn't eliminate=20
other factors, such as polluted water or contaminated fish, that=20
also could have been responsible.=20
=20=20
Now other scientists have published a paper indicating that air=20
pollution is indeed the likely culprit behind the mutations.=20
What's more, there's no reason why human DNA should be immune=20
from the same pollution. So our genes may also be damaged and=20
inherited by our children. It's sobering to think that chemicals=20
in our air affect us at a genetic level. Few studies have been=20
done on this topic outside examinations of animals exposed to=20
radioactive dust from nuclear accidents.=20
=20=20
To examine the effect of air pollution, the researchers exposed=20
two groups of mice for 10 weeks =D1 one just one kilometer (.62=20
miles) from two of Hamilton's steel mills, the other 30=20
kilometers (18.6 miles) away in a rural area. They fed both=20
groups the same diet, gave them bottled water and tended to them=20
in the same way. Essentially, the only difference between the=20
two groups was the air they breathed.=20
=20=20
The offspring of the group housed near the steel mills suffered=20
from up to twice as many mutations as offspring from the rural=20
group. Those "steel mill" mice also produced 20 percent smaller=20
litters. The researchers conclude: "We therefore attribute the=20
effect on inherited mutations in the offspring of sentinel mice=20
directly to variation in air quality between the steel and the=20
rural field sites."=20
=20=20
First gulls, now mice. There's a good chance that air pollution=20
is causing mutations in humans as well. Mice and humans are both=20
mammals and share 99 percent of the same genes. What's bad for=20
them is generally bad for us, too. In this case, the damage=20
seems to affect mostly male mice and their offspring, but the=20
researchers caution that female mice are likely not immune.=20
=20=20
That male mice were especially affected is cause for concern,=20
given that they were only exposed to the polluted air for 10=20
weeks. Steelworkers tend to be male and may be exposed to high=20
levels of pollutants for years. Similarly, those living in the=20
immediate vicinity of mills will be exposed for long periods=20
of time, thereby increasing the chances of genetic damage.=20
=20=20
Yet the steel industry response to the study was shocking. One=20
industry spokesperson actually told the Canadian Press: "We=20
dismiss this study as speculative and irresponsible." I guess=20
I shouldn't be surprised. The response is reminiscent of the=20
tobacco industry line when confronted with evidence of the harm=20
caused by smoking. Rather than saying, "Wow, that's a disturbing=20
finding. We'll fund further studies and look at ways to reduce=20
our emissions in the meantime," industry simply dismisses sound=20
science out of hand.=20
=20=20
Tobacco and steel share another commonality: the chemicals=20
thought to be responsible for the mutations in the Hamilton=20
mouse study are also found in cigarette smoke. They're called=20
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, a group of about 100=20
different chemicals that are created largely when fossil fuels=20
are burned, but are also found in charred food and cigarettes.=20
PAH levels around steel mills in Hamilton are 50 times higher=20
than in rural areas.=20
=20=20
"There is an urgent need to investigate the genetic consequences=20
associated with exposure to chemical pollution through the=20
inhalation of urban and industrial air," the Hamilton researchers=20
say. Indeed, with the vast majority of us now living in urban=20
areas and millions of people exposed to air pollution from steel=20
mills, coal-fired power plants and automobiles, we cannot afford=20
to simply accept the industry line of doing nothing =D1 especially=20
when it could be the next generation that suffers the most.=20
