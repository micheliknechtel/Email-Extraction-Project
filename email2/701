Mediterranean Garlic chicken
This is a very tasty dish that you use quite a bit of garlic with, 20
cloves.  Believe it or not, but we did not find it overpowering.  Its
also one of those dishes you can keep heating in the stove as you finish
up the rest of your meal.  Goes great with mashed potatoes or rice.  Very
little fat is added to this recipe.  If you like you could spray your
pan with a cooking spray.

Jalapeno-Lime Chicken
Another tasty low in fat chicken dish.  You can prepare some of this=20
dish ahead of time and take it out and finish cooking it when your ready.
The jalapenos add just the right amount of zing to this dish.  Very
tasty, and comes with one of its own side dishes.

Amaretto Chicken
Amaretto adds the perfect touch to this dish.  This dish is not low in=20
calories due to the amaretto, but its very very tasty.  Amaretto and
orange juice make this dish extra special.

Green Burrito's Fish Tacos
Who would have thought that years ago Fish tacos would be so delicious.
Emily, one of our fellow viewers sent in her recipe.  If you have never
tried one, they are very good, fresh cabbage, tangy sauce, a bit of cheese,=
 and crispy fish on warm corn tortillas are wonderful.  If you haven't trie=
d these before, I would highly recommend this unique taco.

Applebee's Chimicheese Cake
Not one of the easiest desserts to make, but they will get gobbled up.
We really enjoyed these, and developed a similar recipe.  These are
Chimicheese cakes, cheesecake filling in deep fried flour tortillas that
you sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, and caramel.  Apple filling adds
a special touch to these.

CopyKat Recommends
With the first of the New Year for us comes watching the waste line all
over again.  We really like Weight Watchers Cookbooks.  We have several.
Their recipes tend to be flavorful, lower in fat, and encoporate healthier =
balanced eating.  Recipes from this book for the most part do not taste lik=
e they are diet food.  Garlic Broccoli is a wonderful way to enjoy broccoli=
.  Their soups are excellent and filling, as are their recipes for white fi=
sh in this cookbook.
