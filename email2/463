          Theme: Getting Past the Spam Filters, Part 2
           http://www.wilsonweb.com/wmt8/issue120.htm

Dear Joe,

The December 2002 issue of Web Marketing Today focused on how to
lessen spam filters' impact on your e-mail newsletter or
legitimate opt-in e-mail to your customer list. This month we
continue with several articles on particular approaches to the
spam problem:

  * Review: Habeas Sender Warranted Email
  * Review: Cloudmark SpamNet
  * How to Protect Your E-Mail Address from Spambots
  * How to Make URLs Clickable by AOL Subscribers

I hope you had a wonderful holiday.

I spent some of my time studying my Internet business and deciding
what to trim down and what to expand. For the present I've
decided, for example, not to publish my popular weekly Doctor Ebiz
newsletter (www.doctorebiz.com) on weeks I am publishing Web
Marketing Today. I may change my mind if advertising picks up,
however. :-)

I am planning to extend my Doctor Ebiz Internet Marketing Seminars
this spring to several more cities in the US and Canada. I'm
considering

Atlanta, GA             Las Vegas, NV         Pittsburgh, PA
Buffalo, NY             Los Angeles, CA       Providence, RI
Charlotte, NC           Montreal, QB          Reno, NV
Chicago, IL             Nashville, TN         Salt Lake City, UT
Cleveland, OH           New Orleans, LA       St Louis, MO
Detroit, MI             Orlando, FL           Toronto, ON
Houston, TX             Philadelphia, PA      Vancouver, BC
Kansas City, MO         Phoenix, AZ


but can only select a few of these. Please vote for which cities
you think I should consider.

your help!

for your online business.

               Review: Habeas Sender Warranted Email
                     by Dr. Ralph F. Wilson
             http://www.wilsonweb.com/reviews/habeas.htm
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Spam filters are flagging too many legitimate opt-in e-mails as
spam, know as "false positives." One important answer is for e-
mailers to be able to warrant that their messages are actually
permission-based, certified by a trusted third party. Habeas leads
in such an approach, "fighting spam with poetry." I think Habeas
deserves a very careful look. Read the Review

                     Review: Cloudmark SpamNet

I've fumed about the inaccuracies of spam filters that keep my
newsletters from being delivered. But now I find myself using one
-- Cloudmark SpamNet -- that installs as an add-on to Microsoft
Outlook 2000/XP/2002. I like what it does since it saves me time
every single day. Read the Review

       How to Protect Your E-Mail Address from Spambots
                   by Dr. Ralph F. Wilson
       http://www.wilsonweb.com/wmt8/spambot_hiding.htm
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For $100 or so spammers can purchase software that will
automatically roam Internet webpages looking for e-mail addresses
that it can devour and then bombard with spam for the rest of
their natural lives. Pretty sad! But there are ways to defend
yourself against these monsters of the cyberworld. This article
explains several ways you can disguise, separate, and hide your e-
mail address from spambots, as well as lock them out entirely.

         How to Make URLs Clickable by AOL Subscribers
                   by Dr. Ralph F. Wilson
          http://www.wilsonweb.com/wmt8/aol_links.htm
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Just when I thought AOL had finally "got it" in version 8.0, I
find that URLs in text-only e-mails still aren't visible as
clickable hyperlinks. Here's a work-around for crucial URLs that
must be clicked such as subscription confirmation URLs. Nothing
new -- some of you have been doing it for years -- but important.
