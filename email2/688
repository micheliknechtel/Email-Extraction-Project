Paper Football Online... Requires Shockwave Player

This is a site that Victor from Contests and Games emailed
me last Friday just in time for the NFL Playoffs. Your goal
is to kick the triangular paper football through the goal
posts by controlling the accuracy & power of each kick. The
kicker from the New York Giants could have used this site
as practice before he blew a costly field goal against the 
San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. Check it out at:
