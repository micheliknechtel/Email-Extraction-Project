						<br><b>LETTER FROM THE EDITOR</b>

						<p>"There is more similarity in the marketing challenge of 
						selling a precious painting by Degas and a frosted mug of 
						root beer than you ever thought possible," A. Alfred Taubman,
						the former head of Sotheby's, once said.

						<p>This week's newsletter starts off with an article that helps bridge the gap between marketing that root beer and 
						marketing your story. In <B>Writer's Digest's <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/specialoffers.asp?JANissue">January issue</B></a>, 
						Marketing columnist M.J. Rose offers her tips for marketing 
						<I>your</I> book. It may not be as famous as a painting by Degas...yet!

						<p><B>Bonus Item:</B> My favorite book, <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/specialoffers.asp?10754bk010703"><B>Writer's Market FAQs</B></a>, is 
						highlighted this week. You may have heard of <B>Writer's Market</B> 
						or <a href="http://www.writersmarket.com/specialoffers.asp?WMwebsite"><B>WritersMarket.com</B></a> referred to as the "Writer's Bible." 
						But <B>Writer's Market FAQs</B> is like the Cliff's Notes. It is 
						a book I turn when trying to answer rights or author contracts questions.

						<p>And to help catapult your manuscript out of the slush pile, 
						try taking an online writing class, offered by <B>Writer's Online 
						Workshops</B>. <B>WOW</B> sponsors courses online to help improve your 
						manuscript so that you can get a leg up on the competition. 
						You don't even have to wear clothes to take these Internet classes! 
						Log on to the <a href="http://www.writersonlineworkshops.com/specialoffers.asp?WOWwebsite_nls"><B>Writer's Online Workshops Web site</B></a>  
						for more information. 

						<p>If you register before January 16th, you can take advantage 
						of deep discounts on the first classes of the new year!

						<p>Best wishes

						<br><b>BUILD YOUR BOOK'S BUZZ</b>
						<p><a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/specialoffers.asp?JANissue"><img src="http://newsletters.fwpublications.com/newsletter_images/wd0103.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=5 vspace=5></a>
						<p>In the <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/specialoffers.asp?JANissue"><B>January issue</B></a> of <B>Writer's Digest</B>, M.J. Rose talks 
						about the other side of the writing profession: selling. 
						As she puts it:

						<blockquote>"If you want your book to sell, you need buzz. Buzz is word of 
						mouth. It's one person telling another person telling a third 
						person. Word of mouth is one of the most reliable methods of 
						selling books.

						<p>"The biggest lesson I've learned is that to get buzz you need 
						a marketing hook: one juicy morsel to wrap your whole marketing 
						plan around. One clear, catchy and tempting tidbit to dangle 
						on the end of every e-mail you write, every banner you exchange 
						and every postcard you send. You must be as creative with your 
						hook as you were with your book."</blockquote>

						<p>To learn more about hooking potential readers, you can read 
						M.J. Rose's article online by <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/specialoffers.asp?buzzarticle010703"><B>clicking here</B></a>.

						<br><b>PROFESSIONAL EDITING ADVICE</b>

					<P><a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/specialoffers.asp?JANwritingclinic"><img src="http://newsletters.fwpublications.com/newsletter_images/wc1202.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=5 vspace=5></a>
						
					    <p>In a <B>Writer's Digest</B> special publication, <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/specialoffers.asp?JANwritingclinic"><B>Writing Clinic</B></a>, 
						Stephenie Steel outlines the editing advice available for 
						a writer whose story is on the rocks. She says:

						<blockquote><p>"Writing is by its very nature a solitary craft. In fact, 
						most of us relish those precious hours&#151;or even minutes&#151;that 
						we manage to steal away from our busy lives to be alone 
						with our writing. But every writer, from struggling beginner 
						to flourishing freelancer, occasionally needs to interact 
						with other writers, to get feedback from someone other than 
						well-meaning spouses and curmudgeonly, overworked editors.

						<p>"<B>WritersOnlineWorkshops.com</B> offers timeless writing instruction 
						with a 21st-century twist. Our virtual classrooms provide all 
						the instructor feedback and group interaction you'd expect 
						from a local class or on-site workshop, but without the 
						attendant hassles. You don't even have to get dressed if 
						you don't want to. Best of all, we employ an asynchronous 
						discussion model that allows students all over the world 
						to participate at their convenience&#151;day or night. 

						<p>"<B>WOW</B> classes are relatively short&#151;from 6 to 14 weeks&#151;and 
						move at a challenging pace. Instructors are "on call" 
						throughout each workshop to provide personal, one-on-one 
						feedback and to participate in class discussions. <B>WOW</B> 
						classes also feature a group critique component where you 
						can share your work with your peers&#151;fellow writers from 
						diverse backgrounds united by common interests and goals."</blockquote>

						<p>Don't forget: The deadline for most of these classes is 
						January 16th!

						<p>Here are two exercises from the popular <b>Writing Effective Dialogue Workshop</b> from WritersOnlineWorkshops.com. 

						<p><ol><li>Many classic movies are remembered for famous lines of dialogue: "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn" (<i>Gone with the Wind</i>); "We'll always have Paris" (<i>Casablanca</i>); "You talkin' to me?" (<i>Taxi Driver</i>); "I'm walkin' here!" (<i>Midnight Cowboy</i>). 
						
						<p>Make a list of your personal favorite one-liners and think about why you like them so much. Then see if you can replace each one with a line that you think would be better.

						<p><li>You know those conversations you've had in your life that you later think of lines you'd wish you'd said?  Here's your chance. Write a conversation you had earlier today, transcribing it as accurately as you can remember. Then rewrite the dialogue, giving yourself better lines. Go back to older, more significant conversations&#151;that guy who dumped you in your favorite restaurant, that boss who fired you before you could tell him off&#151;and rewrite those.

						</ol>

						<p>The next session of the <b>Writing Effective Dialogue Workshop</b> starts on January 23rd. <a href="http://www.writersonlineworkshops.com/viewworkshop.asp?workshopid=1021"><b>Register now to reserve your space</b></a>.

						<br><b>HOT TOPICS IN THE WRITERSDIGEST.COM FORUM</b>

						<p>New to the Discussion Forum on the <b>Writer's Digest</b> Web site:

						<P>In the <B>January issue</B> of <B>Writer's Digest</B>, Steven Goldsberry 
						critiques "Goddess in the Pillar," a manuscript provided by 
						Kevin L. Borgan. 

					<P>Goldsberry says character development is one aspect of 
						the story that needs reworking:

						<blockquote><P>"In chapter one of 'Goddess in the Pillar,' you present us with 
						a bunch of Daethons. Nice word, but what are they? What do 
						they look like? We're given clues. Daethons are multihumans, 
						but we don't find this out until the second page. What are 
						multihumans?

						<P>"Your story is intriguing, the pacing quick, and you make good 
						use of stock episodes. But you should consider how to better 
						present and describe your characters."</blockquote>

						<P><a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/forum"><B>Read an extended version of "Goddess in the Pillar,"</B></a> then offer your own 
						suggestions on how to bring to life Borgan's fictional 
						characters.
