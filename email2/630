Greetings fellow quote lovers:

Edward Gibbon published "The History of the Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire" in, of all years, 1776. Many have drawn
a parallel between the power of America today and the Roman
Empire of 2000 years ago. It is an interesting concept that I
leave you to contemplate....


Dreams pass into the reality of action. From the actions
stems the dream again; and this interdependence produces
the highest form of living.
--Anais Nin, Writer (1903-1977)


Best,

               *---- Quote of the Day ----*

Rome, in her present exalted situation, had much less to
hope than to fear from the chance of arms; and that, in the
prosecution of remote wars, the undertaking became, every
day, more difficult, the event more doubtful, the
possession more precarious, and less beneficial.
--Edward Gibbon on the Roman Empire, published 1776
