TAKING AIM AT TRANS FATTY ACIDS - By Colette Bouchez, HealthScoutNews

Just as most Americans are finally digesting the nutrition labels appeari=
ng=20
on all processed foods, the Food and Drug Administration (news - web site=
s)=20
sits poised to add another term on the back of your favorite box of cooki=
es=20
or package of lunch meat.

That term is "trans fatty acid." And some time early this year, the FDA i=
s=20
expected to start requiring that manufacturers include these levels along=
=20
with listings for other types of fat content already mandated on food=20
labels.

"This is a good thing, because it will provide consumers with more=20
information about the foods they are consuming so they can make better fo=
od=20
choices," says Cindy Moore, director of nutrition therapy at the Clevelan=
d=20
Clinic Foundation, and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Associatio=
n.

Trans fatty acids or -- "TFAs" -- are a type of saturated fat that occurs=
=20
naturally in small amounts in foods like beef and dairy products.

But trans fatty acids can also be the end result of a manufacturing proce=
ss=20
that turns healthy liquid fats -- like vegetable oil -- into unhealthy so=
lid=20
fats needed to produce many foods, particularly baked goods and snacks. A=
s=20
such, they show up in a wide variety of products you commonly eat, often =
in=20
large amounts.

"If you eat any commercially prepared foods, particularly baked goods,=20
chances are you are getting a fair amount of TFAs in your diet," Moore sa=
ys.

This matters, she adds, because studies now show that trans fatty acids c=
an=20
increase some specific health risks -- particularly the risk of heart=20
disease.

"The higher your intake of trans fatty acids, the higher your ratio of LD=
L=20
(bad) cholesterol to HDL (good) cholesterol. And that plays out in terms =
of=20
the risk for heart disease," Moore says.

But it's not only your heart that can suffer. The very latest studies sho=
w=20
that high levels of trans fatty acids can also increase your risk of Type=
 II=20
diabetes.

In fact, all things being equal, the negative effects of TFAs on your hea=
lth=20
are even greater than those of the much-ballyhooed saturated fats -- the=20
traditionally bad, "heart-hurting" fats found in foods like butter and=20
cream.

"All fats are bad, and no high fat foods are good for your health. But if=
=20
you have to choose between a food high in saturated fats and one high in=20
trans fat, the one high in trans fat would probably be slightly worse for=
=20
you in terms of your heart health," says New York University nutritionist=
=20
and dietitian Samantha Heller.

But how much trans fatty acid is considered too much? In an effort to ans=
wer=20
this question, the FDA asked the National Institute of Medicine (news - w=
eb=20
sites) to study the issue and come up with a number that could make its w=
ay=20
onto food labels.

That report, issued last fall, found that no level of trans fatty acids i=
s=20
considered "safe."

Since trans fatty acids are present in so many foods, the institute's rep=
ort=20
also concluded that eliminating TFAs from your diet would cause such a=20
dramatic change in your eating habits that it could lead to deficiencies =
of=20
needed nutrients.

The suggested compromise: Strive to keep trans fatty acids as low as=20
possible. And in this respect, the new labels can help.

"If we look for foods that are low in TFAs and low in saturated fats, we =
are=20
definitely making smarter food choices," says Heller.

Although the TFA regulation is likely to become mandatory sometime in the=
=20
next few months, it could take up to 15 months before the new labels begi=
n=20
appearing in stores.

In the meantime, Moore says you can still make smarter food choices by=20
reducing your intake of any foods that list "partially hydrogenated oils"=
 in=20
their ingredient list.

"Most partially hydrogenated oils are trans fatty acids, and the less we=20
consume of these ingredients, the better off our heart and our health wil=
l=20
be," she says.

Currently the FDA-required food labels list total fat content, along with=
=20
breakdowns for the following types of fat:

*    Saturated fats -- found in animal meats, including beef, veal, lamb =
and=20
pork, as well as poultry, butter, cream, whole milk, and whole cheeses.=20
Plant sources include coconut and palm kernel oil and cocoa butter.

*    Polyunsaturated fats (the "good" fat) found in plant oils such as=20
safflower, sesame, sunflower, corn and soybean, as well as nuts and seeds.

*    Monounsaturated fats (another "good" fat) found in canola, olive and=
=20
peanut oil and avocados.

According to the American Heart Association (news - web sites), choosing=20
foods high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat may help lower your=
=20
blood cholesterol when used in place of saturated fat.

WHY SHOULD I CLEANSE?=20

Millions of us suffer from disease, sickness and pain because we simply=20
don't know this truth about our own health: our bodies are not properly=20
eliminating poisons and environmental toxins. The colon's job is to hold=20
waste before it is evacuated from the body and to reabsorb water from the=
=20
waste. Years of poor eating habits, low-fiber diets, sedentary living and=
=20
other lifestyle choices can slow the digestive processes. If waste sits i=
n=20
the colon too long, toxins build up there and are eventually absorbed bac=
k=20
into the body. A toxic colon eventually leads to a toxic liver, which=20
pollutes the tissues and the bloodstream, making a person very sick.
