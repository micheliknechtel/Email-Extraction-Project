TECH INVESTOR

For Tech, Bush's Plan Is No Help
By Eric Hellweg

http://www.business2.com/articles/web/0,,46302,00.html

Tech companies and their investors are scratching their heads
today. They had hoped the Bush economic stimulus plan would help
restart the industry, but now the painful realization is setting
in: They got left behind. 

Oh sure, the short extension of unemployment benefits and the
creation of a $3,000 reemployment stipend for each jobless
citizen ("Joy -- more resume classes!") will help out the
thousands of out-of-work tech employees, but nothing in the Bush
plan will help their former employers hire them back. And with
the Democrats in the minority and needing to appear as the
Anti-Bush, there's nothing in their counterproposal -- which
leans heavily in favor of individuals, not corporations -- that
will help out the tech industry directly.

The item everyone's talking about, the center of Bush's plan, is
his proposal to do away with dividend taxes for individual
shareholders. That's all well and good for investors in companies
such as R.J. Reynolds and Goodyear Tire & Rubber, which regularly
pay dividends, but very few technology companies ever pay
dividends. Cisco? Nope. Dell? Nope. Intel? Nope. Microsoft? Ha --
come on. [Two of the very few that do are IBM and Apple.] That's
because hardly any tech companies have the kind of bedrock cash
flow required to offer payouts to investors. "In general, tech
companies are focused on betting the company on the next
generation," says Rick White, CEO of TechNet, a Silicon
Valley-based tech lobbying organization. "They need every dime
they can get."

Some tech companies are re-examining their dividend policy in
light of Bush's proposal. Two quarters ago, in its conference
call with analysts, Dell said the elimination of the dividend tax
could push them in the direction of paying a dividend, Mike
Maher, a Dell spokesman, confirmed Tuesday that if the dividend 
tax were to disappear, "it would factor into our decision. It's
something we're looking at." Joseph Beaulieu, an analyst with
MorningStar, says he hopes the dividend plan ushers in more
widespread tech dividends, since the move would "force management
to think about building sustainable cash flows rather than
improving the stock price in the short term," leading to better
corporate governance.

That sounds like a solid plan for the long term. But what this
economy, and the tech sector in particular, needs is some help --
stat. Unfortunately, two items the tech crowd was hoping to find
on Bush's plan aren't on the docket. First is the reduction of
taxes paid by companies seeking to bring earnings made overseas
back to the United States. The government currently taxes these
foreign earnings "at a punitive rate," says TechNet's White, who
estimates that as much as $150 billion in earnings could make its
way back to the United States if the tax rate were reduced as an
incentive. Some estimates place foreign sales at as much as 60
percent of total tech sales, and "companies could use that right
now," White says. But, with Enron: The Crooked E playing as the
CBS movie of the week, both political parties are understandably
hesitant to appear too corporation-friendly. 

Second on the dashed tech wish list is the issue of accelerated
depreciation for information technology purchases. Bush addressed
the issue to some extent with his new plan, increasing the amount
a company can write off immediately to $75,000 from $25,000, but
many tech insiders were hoping for more, especially since many
major tech purchases cost upwards of $1 million. Also, Bush's
increase is geared toward small businesses, not the large
companies that do the bulk of the buying.

So while the rest of the economy picks apart the administration's
and Democrats' stimulus packages, the technology industry must
return to the painful (and so far fruitless) process of figuring
out how to fix itself. And you know what? For the long-term
health of the sector, that might not be such a bad thing.
