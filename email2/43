After PF Vladimir Radmanovic struggled through a 1-for-9 shooting night against the Nuggets on January 3, questions were raised about his effectiveness coming off the bench. The answer? When Reggie Evans (shoulder) went on the injured list to make room for C Jerome James, Radmanovic started games against the Lakers, Spurs and Clippers and averaged 13.3 points and 4.3 rebounds. . . .
Coach Nate McMillan has been shaking up his rotation, hoping to revive a team he claims has gone stale. In consecutive games against the Nuggets, Lakers, Spurs and Clippers, he used four different starting lineups, but none clicked, and the team lost all four.


AROUND THE PACIFIC DIVISION

GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS
The starting backcourt of PG Gilbert Arenas and SG Jason Richardson is logging considerable playing time—Arenas is averaging 35.7 minutes per game, second-most on the team, and Richardson is at 33.6. But coach Eric Musselman seldom plays both at the same time late in close games. 
Musselman inserted PG Earl Boykins for most of the fourth quarter in a 104-99 win over the Wizards last Friday, and Boykins delivered nine points, two assists and the game-clinching jumper with 15.7 seconds left. And because Richardson has struggled defensively, Musselman uses veteran SG Bob Sura to slow down opposing perimeter players. On Friday, Sura held SG Jerry Stackhouse, who had 26 points, to two in the fourth quarter.

LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS
C Michael Olowokandi is putting up solid numbers, averaging 12.7 points and 9.3 rebounds, but he is struggling with his efficiency in the low post. Olowokandi, who often is double-teamed, averages more than twice as many turnovers (3.0) as assists (1.4). The team ranks 24th in the league in turnovers with 15.9 per game. . . .
Although G.M. Elgin Baylor has given coach Alvin Gentry a vote of confidence, some found it surprising that Baylor recently addressed the team—after six straight losses—and talked about offensive and defensive strategy.

LOS ANGELES LAKERS
Coach Phil Jackson seems to be relying less on veterans such as SF Rick Fox, PF Robert Horry and PG Brian Shaw and has reduced their minutes in recent games. Jackson says not only are those players struggling shooting the ball, “they aren't making plays in a game to stay in the game.” Jackson is giving more playing time to C/F Samaki Walker, 26, and rookie SG Kareem Rush, 22, who averages 10.8 minutes but played 25, 24 and 22 in the three games entering last weekend. . . .
SG Kobe Bryant's NBA record 12 3-pointers against the Sonics provided a long-range boost the team hasn't had this year. It ranks 25th in the league in 3-point shooting (32.3 percent). After reducing his 3-point attempts to a career-low 1.6 per game last season, Bryant is taking a career-high 3.1 per game this season.

PHOENIX SUNS
SG Joe Johnson rejoined PG Stephon Marbury in the starting backcourt after SG Penny Hardaway chose to undergo surgery on his right thumb. Hardaway, who suffered the injury in November and tried to play through it, is expected to be out six to eight weeks. In his first start since December 29, Johnson played 22 minutes against the Grizzlies and hit two of nine shots for five points, continuing his recent trend of streaky shooting. . . . 
Rookie PF Amare Stoudemire is getting a crash course in facing double- and triple-teams in the post. He is learning that if teams double-team with a second big man, he can't always elevate over both of them.

PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS
It seems the team and PG Damon Stoudamire are stuck with each another—at least for now. He remains adamant that he won't restructure his contract to make it more possible for the team to trade him. Against the Spurs last week, he came off the bench to spark a 90-87 victory, the team's 11th win in 13 games. But it was just his third appearance in 12 games. . . . 
Filling in for Derek Anderson (ankle), SG Antonio Daniels excelled in wins against the Celtics and Knicks, averaging 12.0 points. Daniels' expanded role fueled speculation the team might be looking to trade him, although no rumored deal has made sense. 

SACRAMENTO KINGS
In a four-game winning streak before last Friday's overtime loss to the Timberwolves, the team had held each opponent to 82 points or fewer. Part of the reason was the absence of PG Bobby Jackson (hand). The team is far more of a running team with Jackson at the point than with Mike Bibby there. . . .
Bibby had a season-high 16 assists in the loss to the Timberwolves. Bibby, whose 4.6-assist average entering the game was way off his 7.1 career mark, has given up some of the primary ballhandling duties while he gets back to 100 percent following a foot injury.
