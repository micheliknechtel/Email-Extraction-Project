RELATED BOOKS:

To sum up the year, I chose the following five sites (from the 
hundreds included in my column) as representative of the 
educational nature of the Internet circa 2002. They were chosen 
for the variety of their topics (biography, film, research, 
literature and geography) and their excellent use of the 
Internet media.  Wishing you a new year  full of wonder and 
educational opportunities.  

Einstein: Image and Impact 
http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/
*****
The American Institute of Physics site explores Einstein's life 
through historical accounts, photographs and sound clips. The 
Brief Version (recommended for elementary students and anyone 
not wanting to read all one hundred pages of the Main Exhibit) 
can be traversed by following the Next Page link at the very 
bottom of each page. Clicking on any other links for more detail 
will take you into the Main Exhibit. To return to your tour 
through the Brief Version, use your browser back button, or 
start again at the home page. 

National Geographic Beyond the Movie: Lord of the Rings
http://www.nationalgeographic.com/ngbeyond/
*****
National Geographic's Beyond the Movie (for middle school 
students and older)includes the author, the book, and the first 
film in its scope. Although the topics (such as the historical, 
cultural and mythological influences on Tolkien) sound very 
academic, National Geographic excels at making it very 
approachable. So is the evil ring a reference to the atomic bomb 
of World War II? "'An author cannot of course remain wholly 
unaffected by his experience,' Tolkien acknowledged, but he 
strongly denied that his story was an allegory for 
World War I or II."

Noodle Quest
http://www.noodletools.com/noodlequest/
*****
Wow! This amazing research tool actually answers the inevitable 
first question: "Where do I start?" Just answer the seven 
multiple-choice questions starting with "Are you a kid, pretty 
new to the Internet, or an Internet wizard?" and click "Show Me 
a Research Strategy." Noodle Quest is terrific because of the 
variety and quality of the research sites it unearths. Book mark 
Noodle Quest now.

PD Reader
http://pdreader.org

term "public domain" refers to works not protected by copyright,

Travel Channel: Lady Liberty 
http://travel.discovery.com/convergence/americanicon/ladyliberty/statue.html
*****
This Lady Liberty site is part of Travel Channel's American 
Icon's series, and earns its stars with  its interactivity. 
Click on Lady Liberty's hot spots (such as her torch, crown, or 
tablet) to learn more about her. As you click, two short 
features will appear in the text box. Use the up and down 
triangles to navigate through the articles. Next stop is the 
Journey to Ellis Island, for audio stories from immigrants. And 
for a final treat, be sure to view the three-minute special Lady 
Liberty tribute slide show.
