Jim Eliot talks about RFB&D's innovations in providing access to the
printed word. This webcast was recorded at the Accessing Higher Ground
Conference in Boulder, Colorado, November 2002.

Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic, (RFB&D), has been the most important
and largest source for access to print text books and scholarly materials
around the world for over half a century.  Personally, I remember using
their products in the early 1950s.  Thousands of visually impaired students
have relied on their services.  Increasingly, students with learning
disabilities have found that audio access to materials serves as a valuable
suppliment to the print copy.  It began by recording on flexible disks and
then switched to taped materials both reel to reel and then cassettes.  Now
that information is all being digitized, it is starting to produce
materials on CD.

This webcast is the first of several recordings that will be broadcast from
the Colorado conference.

Note! EASI's February courses are:
Barrier-free E-learning http://easi.cc/workshops/bfel.htm
Accessible Internet Multimedia http://easi.cc/workshops/mmedia.htm

Barrier-free E-learning is about more than accessible distance education.
Campus-based courses are also putting some materials online.  Is your
online instruction accessible to students with disabilieies?  STudies show
that the odds are that they are not.  This course explains the nature of
the accessibility problems and sets forth strategies to repair existing
materials and to properly design new materials in the future.  The course
is a month long and encourages interaction with instructor and with other
participants.  The instructor, Norman Coombs, has been teaching online for
more than a decade.  He has won awards for mainstreaming students with
disabilities into the courses he taught.  As a user of adaptive technology,
he is personally aware with the problems of accessibility and with
techniques to transcend these barriers.
Accessible Internet Multimedia is for participants with some technical
background in designing multimedia for Web delivery.  While it discusses
creating multimedia itself, the primary focus is on how to make these
products accessible.  This means captions and transcriptions for the Deaf.
Providing some alternative descriptions or alternative materials for users
who are blind or who have low vision.  These same materials are useful for
people with various learning disabilities.

Both courses can earn continuing education credits and these courses will
count toward the Certificate in Accessible Information Technology.
