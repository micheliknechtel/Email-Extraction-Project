                         NOTE FROM CHRIS:

                        Honey, we're home!

        Thank you for indulging us while we recharged our
        comedy batteries.  For our first new list of 2003,
        we've decided to tackle a very serious subject...

           The Hooters restaurant chain recently bought
            a small airline and will operate a charter
              service under the name "Hooters Air."

                   Excerpts from today's list:

                The Top 17 Slogans for Hooters Air


16> Relax -- the *Engines* Are Real

12> We Put the T&A in "Trans-Atlantic"

 8> Full Upright Position?  Count on It!

 3> Pray for Turbulence

              You really can learn things in Lamaze
             classes.  I learned that just because a
            video has a naked lady in it doesn't mean
          that my "bawm-chick-a-bamp bamp" song is going
          to automatically get a laugh out of the room.

                        (Travis Ruetenik)
