BUSH PLAN A BIG FAT ZERO FOR A THIRD OF NATION'S TAXPAYERS

An January 27 CTJ analysis shows that almost a third of singles and couples
would receive absolutely no tax cut from President Bush's proposals to
accelerate some of his previously-enacted tax cuts and exempt dividends
from personal income taxes. 

The analysis is available on CTJ's website at
http://www.ctj.org/html/gwb0103.htm .
