QUOTE SHEET -
"As a captain, I think it's important that the players
really know who you are and what you stand for, what
your beliefs are, and to be consistent in those if
things are going good or things are going bad. You
always have to remain consistent in your beliefs and
philosophy."
      -- New York Rangers captain, Mark Messier,
         in the January issue of Impact!
