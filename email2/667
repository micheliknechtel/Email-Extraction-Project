INVESTOR'S NOTEBOOK by Brendan Boyd

(A digest of investment opinion from the world's leading 
financial advisers)

One reassuring vote of confidence for the stock market comes 
from legendary fund manager Peter Lynch of Fidelity. With 10-
year Treasuries yielding so little, and money-market funds 
paying so much less than the 2 percent dividend yield you can 
get from the S&P 500, Lynch believes that stocks "look like 
a good place to be now if you're a long-term investor."

California is as big as many foreign countries, so a mutual 
fund that devotes most of its portfolio to the state's stocks 
has many issues to choose from. Franklin Flex Cap Growth Fund, 
which has appreciated an average 14.45 percent annually over 
the past decade, focuses on three types of California stocks: 
(1) market-share leaders with high growth prospects, (2) solid 
niche companies selling below their value, (3) extremely over-
sold issues. Recent favorites: Tenet Healthcare, Mattel, 
WellPoint Health Networks, Wells Fargo, Amgen, Fox Entertain-
ment.

Restaurant stocks beat all other S&P sectors in the three years 
following each of the past four recessions, notes Paul Sturm 
of Smart Money magazine (1755 Broadway, New York, NY 10019). 
"Gains averaged 150 percent from trough to peak. Restaurant 
accounting is also straightforward, balance sheets are 
uncluttered, and there aren't many seven-figure CEOs. In today's 
nervous market, restaurant stocks are comfort food." Sturm's 
favorites: AFC Enterprises, Applebee's, Brinker International, 
Buca Inc., Darden Restaurants, RARE Hospitality, Ryan's Family, 
Wendy's International.

Money magazine recently asked the four Wall Street analysts 
ranked tops by the data firm Starmine to name their favorite 
issues. All four analysts have at least five years' experience 
and outperformed their sectors by wide margins over the past 
three years. More important, they're quick to downgrade when 
their recommendations encounter problems. Their picks: Equity 
Resources (by Carol Coale, Prudential Securities utilities 
analyst); Ryanair (Jim Parker, Raymond James airline analyst); 
Hilton Hotels (Bryan Maher, Credit Lyonnais lodging analyst); 
Freddie Mac (Gary Gordon, UBS Warburg bank analyst).

Mutual funds that specialize in particular foreign countries, 
or regions, often charge as much as 2 percentage points an-
nually in overhead. "All the more reason to index," says 
Forbes. "One good way is to buy exchange-traded regional and 
country funds such as Ishares, which trade on the New York 
Stock Exchange. They produce the same results as the indexes 
being tracked and typically charge just 0.5 points in annual 
overhead."

Caveat emptor redux: Auditing firms gave clean bills of health 
to 93.9 percent of the public companies that have subsequently 
been cited for accounting irregularities, according to a new 
study by Weiss Ratings (http://www.WeissRatings.com 
<A HREF="http://www.WeissRatings.com" TARGET="_new" class="charles1">www.WeissRatings.com</A>).
"The stock of the 33 companies studied dropped from a peak 
market value of $1.8 trillion to just $527 billion, implying 
an aggregate loss to shareholders of $1.3 trillion."
