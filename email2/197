Welcome!

Have you resolved to lose weight, stop smoking, or get
more exercise this year? I want you to promise me that
you’ll make one more resolution -- to have more fun with
your computer. Using e-mail and visiting chat rooms can
be valuable, but if you try, you will find even more fun
things to do with your computer. Read on – I’ll give you
a few ideas.

Your online host, 

Sandy Berger

Games are not Just for Kids 

They were fun when you were a kid, and they can be just as
much fun now. The Internet brings gaming options 
extraordinaire.         
http://aarp.post.intellimedia.com/UM/T.asp?A910.16600.1237.1.45195  


Resolutions for Happy Computing

Make 2003 a year to really enjoy your computing. Here are
a few New Year Resolutions to help you in your quest for
Happy Computing.       
http://aarp.post.intellimedia.com/UM/T.asp?A910.16600.1237.2.45195   


New Retirement

It’s not your father’s retirement anymore. Today retirement
can be a time to fulfill your dreams and your computer and
the Internet can help.    
http://aarp.post.intellimedia.com/UM/T.asp?A910.16600.1237.3.45195


iPod – Music to Go

Now available for PCs as well as Macs, the Apple iPod
is a portable music player that can put a little fun in
your life. Perhaps you can use it while you are fulfilling
your New Year resolution to get more exercise.   
http://aarp.post.intellimedia.com/UM/T.asp?A910.16600.1237.4.45195


Free Wireless

What could be more fun than something free? How about
free wireless Internet service in a local park or
restaurant? It’s an exciting new concept, and it is
here now.     
http://aarp.post.intellimedia.com/UM/T.asp?A910.16600.1237.5.45195


Get Computer Help

Everyone needs a little help every now and then. Visit
our Computers & Technology Message Boards to get answers
to all your computer questions. Even if you don’t have any
questions, a quick visit is sure to be worthwhile.     
http://aarp.post.intellimedia.com/UM/T.asp?A910.16600.1237.6.45195


A Moment with Sandy

We all know that having fun is important, but sometimes
it is the last thing on our “to do” list. Finding fun
computer projects and products can be a way to integrate
a little enjoyment into our every day lives. I have a
large mouse that sits on top of my computer. He has hands
that attach to the sides of the computer. I know, it’s
just a silly little thing, but when I look at him, he
makes me smile. I hope that this year you will all
find something to makes you smile everyday. 

Happy Computing!
