=============================
Do You Own the Right Stocks for 2003?
=============================

Dear Investor,

My name is Louis Navellier, and I want to offer you some FREE advice to
get you started right for 2003.

[Here’s why you should listen:  According to The Hulbert Financial
Digest-the industry’s independent watchdog-the aggressive newsletter I
started in the mid-1980s, MPT Review, has GAINED 2,899% in the last
seventeen years (versus just 975% for the S&P 500).  What’s more, since
I started my Blue Chip Growth Letter-suitable for all, even
conservative, investors-in late 1997, our portfolio has BEATEN the S&P
nearly 6-to-1.]

FREE advice-no obligation to buy anything.  Advice tailored specifically
to the risks and opportunities in the market right now.

========
The Risks
========

Please don’t believe the Pollyanna crowd, telling everyone who’ll listen
that the market is set to boom in 2003.

It’s NOT.

I do believe the market will trend higher.  But-and this is critically
important-just 15%-to-20% of all stocks will do the "heavy lifting." 
Many more will stagnate.  And the worst of the bunch will drop like
rocks!

Why?

Simple-there’s no traction in their business models.  There are still
dozens of companies-in tech, finance, retailing, manufacturing and
nearly every sector-whose sales and profits are in the toilet.  And with
a shaky economic recovery, their prospects WON’T get better anytime
soon.

I name the worst offenders in my NEW report "31 Big-Name Stocks You Must
Sell Now."  Get it FREE immediately online by going here now:
http://investorplace.com/order/?pc=2LW236

================
Don’t Take Big Risks
=================

I provide regular sell-side advice to my Blue Chip Growth Letter
subscribers.

Back in March - when many advisors proclaimed the bear market dead-I
urged investors to dump:

** WorldCom (now bankrupt) ** Nortel (down 67% since) ** Williams
Companies (down 86%) ** Tyco (down 44%) ** Bristol-Myers Squibb (down
43%) ** Flextronics (down 37%) ** AMR Corp (down 71%) ** and dozens
more.

Now I’m warning you again, investors face more huge losses now in stocks
like these:

· 2 dominant retailers that have thoroughly messed up their winning
formulas.  Sell now!
· 7 widely-owned technology stocks that could still take years to
recover.  Get out before they plunge again!
· A pharmaceutical dinosaur; 2 once-golden brand names now in deep
trouble; 3 American has-beens that once dominated world manufacturing;
and more.

Must Sell Now" FREE by going here now:

=============
The Opportunities
=============

The only companies you want to own now are those I call EARNINGS
MONSTERS.

At my Blue Chip Growth Letter, we own stocks with rapidly-growing
earnings - and DUMP them when their businesses start to cool off. 
That’s how we were able to bank gains in EMC Corp (+466%), Nokia
(+316%), Cisco (+201%) and many others - while most investors rode these
stocks all the way back down.

In today’s economy, true Earnings Monsters are few and far between.  But
we own the best of the lot-businesses that dominate the competitive
landscape-at my Blue Chip Growth Letter.

And I’ll name two of my favorites-2 Top Buys for 2003-FREE.  Just go
here now: http://investorplace.com/order/?pc=2LW236

=========
Yours FREE
=========

This is my way of introducing you to the work I do at my Blue Chip
Growth Letter (maybe you’ll give it a try some time).

Get "31 Big-Name Stocks You Must Sell Now" and "2 Top Buys for
2003"-both FREE (there’s no obligation to buy a thing).  Go here now:
http://investorplace.com/order/?pc=2LW236

Sincerely,

Louis Navellier
Blue Chip Growth Letter

P.S.  2003 will be a great year for those investors who: a)  avoid the
most dangerous big-name stocks; and b) own those companies with
exceptional earnings growth.
