Dear ESSENCE.com friends:

Happy New Year! I trust everyone had a healthy and happy holiday. Each New Year is a new beginning. We start diets and exercise plans and resolve to make big changes in our lives. ESSENCE.com profiles two young actors experiencing major changes in their careers. Derek Luke and Joy Bryant give amazing performances in Antwone Fisher, Denzel Washington's remarkable directorial debut. We caught up with Luke and Bryant and chatted with them about their big break, working with Washington, the Academy Award-winning actor, and what's next for their careers.
