Expanets CEO Hooks Into Profits
Define a goal, map out a plan, get friendly with the board of 
directors and then execute. That's John Charters' modus operandi for 
success in the IP voice/data market. Before becoming CEO of 
voice/data integrator Expanets in April, Charters was a member of the 
company's board. That experience has given him the insight and the 
relationships with top executives to carry through on his vision: to 
make Expanets the leading provider of voice/data infrastructure.

IT Services Outlook Improves
Here's a welcome forecast to ring in the new year: Spending
growth in IT services is expected to return. "The sale of
software and related consulting services is expected to lead
IT spending back into positive territory," said Stephen
Minton, research director at IDC, during a recent technology
conference. "The pent-up demand to move on to more
sophisticated IT solutions will benefit consultants and
service providers alike."

Secrets To High-Flying Success
It has been another arduous year for solution providers. According to 
VARBusiness' 2003 State of the Market research, only 14 percent of 
solution providers indicated their previous six-month revenues were 
above expectations, while 44 percent said revenues for the same time 
frame were below expectations. With no certain end to the economic 
slump in sight, solution providers may be wise to emulate the 
so-called "highflyers", those companies that excel despite slow 
spending.

Lexmark Moves to Win Over VARs
If timing is everything, then the moment for Lexmark to advance has 
arrived. Arguably, no other company stands to benefit from the merger 
between Hewlett-Packard and Compaq than the Lexington, Ky.-based 
printer giant, other than, perhaps, Dell. That's because the 
uncertainty that stems from the megamerger of the world's leading 
printer company with the one-time leader in PCs has prompted more 
printer VARs to rethink their supplier relationships than ever 
before.
