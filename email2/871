DAVID FEHERTY MAILBAG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I heard a Danish IOC member stating that the world's best golf players would never be interested in playing golf at the Olympic Games because they make too much money. Would it be possible to get the players' point of view and, of course, your point of view?
-- Johnny Nielsen, Atlanta

I don't think I'd agree with the Danish IOC member on at least one count here, although IOC members seem to be the last group of people left on Earth to realize that some Olympians are making a lot of money. If an Ethiopian millet-herder can scrape a four-year living out of the games, I'm thinking the average pro golfer might have a chance. The real problem is, no one has invented a drug that enhances a golfer's performance. (There was that wee blue one that helped Bill Clinton, but I don't think it counts.)
No, I don't expect to see golfers in the Olympic Games until golf becomes a test of endurance or speed. Then, you can bet someone will take a crack at it.
