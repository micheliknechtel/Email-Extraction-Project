Friday Networking Tech Log: Higher Powers                 
By Dominic Preziosi

Optimism is always in plentiful supply at the start of a year, but a little divine intervention wouldn't hurt either. The Vatican Web site is already powered by host computers named after the archangels Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael. But I was happier to see that an Italian mobile operator is now offering an SMS prayer-a-day service to subscribers (see http://update.techweb.com/cgi-bin4/flo?y=eKL80BYPnm0CLh0BplM0Ac ). Is there an intercession for the IT industry?

Meanwhile, the Mac faithful (cultists all?) gathered for their revival this week in San Francisco (see http://update.techweb.com/cgi-bin4/flo?y=eKL80BYPnm0CLh0BplK0Aa ). St. Stephen Jobs, he of the $1 dollar salary, presented his usual array of good works -- a new notebook, new presentation software, new wireless networking gear -- but at last word had performed no miracles (though the devoted still maintain there's a way to compete with Microsoft).

Those with more temporal concerns may be interested in HP's latest infrastructure and network service outsourcing deal (see http://update.techweb.com/cgi-bin4/flo?y=eKL80BYPnm0CLh0BplN0Ad ). But for a good scare, read it in conjunction with Larry Lange's Mad As Hell column on offshore outsourcing. You may get religion.
