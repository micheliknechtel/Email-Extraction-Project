Editor’s Note: We continue with this two-part analysis that 
seeks to understand US foreign policy in the Middle East. 
When there are billions of dollars involved, people do not 
always want their intentions under scrutiny. Foreign policy 
is never quite as "advertised" by administrations or proponents. 
One needs to enter the labyrinth to understand its paths. If 
you would like to read part one of this analysis, please visit:

Inside the Labyrinth - Part Two - by Jaffer Ali

Zionist Controlled Media?

Related to the pro-Israel lobby theory of political control
in foreign policy making is the oft-repeated canard that 
Zionists control the media. At times this slips into the racist 
formulation that "Jews control the media." This theory 
hypothesizes that because of this "control" Israel therefore 
will always enjoy favorable positioning in the media.

It is undeniable that Jewish representation in the film and 
television industries outweighs their proportional numbers. Is 
it reasonable to ask whether this makes a difference anyway? 
The media control theory suggests that public opinion determines 
foreign policy. But is US public opinion important in the 
formulation of foreign policy? If Congress does not create 
foreign policy, neither will a constituency of which 66% of the 
population doesn’t even know where Canada is.

With the notable exceptions of Conrad Black, Norman Podhoretz, 
and Mortimer Zuckerman, large corporate media companies are 
beholden to their shareholders AND NOT FOREIGN interests. The 
three listed Zionists are rather marginal characters in the 
entire media landscape and the premise of media control is 
unfortunately used to distract from the true reality. Public 
media companies must answer to shareholders. Private media 
companies are not, and today, most news is in the hands of
large media conglomerates.

   **   Nostradamus - The Man Who Saw Tomorrow   **

Hosted by Orson Welles, this is still one of the most 
talked about videos ever made and now with the tragic events 
surrounding The World Trade Center, this video is more 
relevant than ever! Take a look at the predictions of 16th 
century French astrologer and physician Nostradamus. Some 
say he correctly predicted the fall of King Louis XVI, the 
rise of Napoleon and the assassination of President John F. 
Kennedy. Plus an attack on the America's that is eerily 
similar to the World Trade Center. Watch if you dare!

This aside, only public acquiescence is required to maintain 
various foreign policy agendas. Public opinion is malleable to 
a large extent. Consider how malleable it is when 90% of the US 
public supported the first Persian Gulf War... to ostensibly 
reinstall one dictatorial regime from the ravages of another. 
The war was sold with an almost hysterical media bandwagon.

Most people simply do not care about foreign policy until American 
soldiers begin to die. In most cases, mainstream media reflects 
official US policy. There is a subtle collusion between 
conventional media and official policy. If reporters buck the 
official policy line, they may find themselves without future 
access to "inside sources".

News divisions once upon a time were immune to economic pressures. 
This meant that they could run more stories that connected policies 
to large corporate interests without fear of advertising being 
pulled. But now that news divisions must also be profit centers, 
they are now beholden to advertisers. Advertisers like British 
Petroleum, Chevron, Unisys and others will not advertise in 
network news slots if they run counter to their interests. These 
economic giants therefore can influence the agenda of media outlets 
just enough to create the necessary acquiescence.

The media has had a love affair with Israel for over 50 years. For 
all intents and purposes, the Palestinian narrative was almost 
never heard. This was because official US policy did not recognize 
Palestinians. Many Israelis still hold to the notion that there are 
no "Palestinians." The fact of an almost non-existent Palestinian 
narrative led most to believe that Zionist media control kept that 
voice mute. Again, we have the wrong culprit... and the wrong 
analysis. In the corporate world of media, only narratives that are 
in synch with official policy break through the clutter.

Fifty Years Of Coinciding Interests

The hidden truth is that American and Israeli interests coincided 
for so many years. But the reality of coinciding interests remained 
almost a state secret for both countries. US Middle East foreign 
policy is about O-I-L... and connecting the dots how Israel helped 
promote oil interests was to be hidden at any cost. Why?

The Arab oil monarchies REQUIRED this fact to be hidden from 
view. If it looked like there was collusion between oil interests 
and the establishment, and subsequent promotion of a Zionist state, 
the constituencies of these autocratic regimes might rise and 
destabilize the regime... thus interfere with cheap access to 
the oil.

That is why every single Arab regime obfuscates the connection 
between Israel’s historic role in the region and oil politics. It 
is legerdemain of the highest order. The Arab street has been 
pacified for years through obfuscation. Thrones depended upon it! 
What is Israel’s historic role in the region?

Israel was to be the quasi-colonial implant created to preserve 
Western interests. It was to be the bulwark against post-WW II 
revolutionary movements. In Cold War politics, it would be a 
bastion against Soviet expansion. It would share intelligence
with the West... all designed to maintain regional proxy leader-
ship like the Shah of Iran and the House of Saud. This is where 
the oil was after all. Israel’s MOSSAD would train SAVAK (Iranian 
secret police) and guarantee the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan 
through secret alliances.

Israel would create cover for regional monarchies. All Arab 
governments lack legitimacy. Arab leaders did not ascend to power 
through the ballot box...but were basically installed. As long as 
Israel could be blamed for a lack of freedom, dissent was 
harmlessly channeled from internal dynamics to external issues. 
Israel served the role of goat let to draw the wolves away from 
the flock.

In 1948, Secretary of State George Marshall argued vociferously 
against this position, suggesting that eventually a western colony 
would backfire against US economic interests. He lost the argument. 

The cost to the US in maintaining Israel is a matter of intense 
debate. Forecasts range from $170 billion in actual aid to over 
$1 trillion when you add the "soft aid" that is doled out to 
countries like Turkey. Turkey has received billions of dollars 
in subsidies to trade with Israel. Israel receives oil from the 
US because no Arab country (until recently) could openly sell gas 
and oil to it, lest the collusion be revealed (Egypt now sells gas 
to Israel although it is not a widely circulated fact.)

The Changing Face Of American Interests

One can reasonably argue that the cost of maintaining Israel has 
outweighed the benefits. This is certainly the case with many 
colonial adventures. The notion that the Islamic Middle East 
could ever have been over-run by godless Communism seems 
ridiculous in retrospect (see Chechnya and Afghanistan of the 
80’s.) So the Israeli role as a counter balance to Soviet designs 
was always a questionable assertion. But today the Soviet Union 
is but a faded memory. Revolutions occurred in Egypt, Iraq, Libya 
and Iran in spite of Israel existing.

The emergence of critiques and dissent that questions the 
legitimacy of regional monarchies has begun... and will not abate. 
Israeli bases are no longer needed as a staging point since 
facilities in Qatar are closer to the oil fields than Haifa. Israel 
is a nuisance when it comes to building any coalition in the region 
and its vaunted intelligence capabilities did not help the US prior 
to the 9-11 carnage.

When you list Israel’s past role and compare it to today’s reality, 
she no longer has a role to play. When colonies no longer serve 
the interests of their sponsors, they become a burden. Israel is 
an economic burden to the US.

The Palestinian narrative has begun to surface almost on cue. 
Large media outlets like the Chicago Tribune, CNN and the 
Washington Post are routinely picketed by pro-Zionist supporters. 
This severely challenges the "Zionist control theory" of the 
media. Observing media spin is one way of discerning the 
direction of foreign policy.  Remember, media reflects policy. 
Israeli occupation has done what no Muslim leader has been able
to do in 1000 years... and that is to unite the Islamic street.

We see US goods boycotted en masse. Zam Zam Cola is outselling 
Coca Cola throughout the Middle East. McDonald’s, an American 
icon, has its stores coming under pressure in the Muslim world 
from Indonesia to Amman. Restaurant closings all over the Middle 
East and Muslim countries have become routine. Why?

All polls suggest that US support of Israel has broadened the 
enmity to include US economic interests. 30% of all US exports 
go to the Middle East, and this is declining due to the 
unresolved Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

The Israeli colonial adventure has finally reached the point
of all colonial endeavors. The cost outweighs the benefits. 
Palestine is now the number one issue, not just in the Arab 
world but in the entire Muslim world from Kenya to Pakistan. 
Proxy Arab leaders are losing their grip on their illegitimate 
thrones.

George Marshall warnings have come to pass... and as Lord 
Palmerston, the British Foreign Secretary said in the 19th 
Century,

"There are no permanent alliances, only permanent interests."

We are at the beginning of a new age where Israeli and US interests 
are diverging. Globalization, the new requirements for maintaining 
access to cheap oil, the growing Islamic market for US goods and 
culture, the necessity to solve the Palestinian question and 
Israel’s colonial past are all coinciding for a new foreign 
policy agenda.
