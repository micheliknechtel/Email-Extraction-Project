------------------------------ LISTEN UPDATE ------------------------------


Dear Fellow Listeners,

If you hear screaming that's my coworkers and I sharing our joy at the news
that two of our audiobooks are finalists for GRAMMY AWARDS!  Michael J Fox's
LUCKY MAN and Christopher Reeve's NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE.

You might remember that last April I could barely contain my excitement when
I wrote to you about the newly released audiobook, LUCKY MAN by the
charming, endearing, adorable crush of my youth, Michael J. Fox.  He may not
have been a bad boy on screen as Family Ties' Alex P. Keaton, Back to the
Future's Marty McFly or Spin City's Emmy and Golden Globe award-winning,
Michael Flaherty, but in his own personal life, Fox was a bit more on the
wild side.  In LUCKY MAN Fox skips nothing, detailing the ups and downs in
his life in compelling anecdotes from a night out with Cheer's Woody
Harrelson and a movie screening with the late Princess Diana, to his battle
with alcoholism and his diagnosis with Parkinson's disease.

A public figure and a private man, Michael J. Fox lets listeners inside his
life as never before in this enjoyable audiobook brimming with emotion and
honesty, and told by a man who despite his personal obstacles is able to
look at his life, at his supportive, loving family and at his more than 20
year career and recognize that he is, indeed, a very lucky man.

Christopher Reeve's star turn as Superman in the 80's big screen film series
made him a beloved actor and a household name.  Reeve's well-publicized
struggle with a life-altering spinal cord injury suffered during a 1995
horseback riding accident, and his ability to put the negative aside and
look at life with optimism despite the barriers it has put in his way, is an
example of strength for me and I truly believe, for anyone who listens to
this powerful and moving audiobook.  

Read by Reeve himself, the emotion in this story is palpable in every
syllable and every word.  In 1998 Reeve's won a Grammy for his
autobiography, Still Me, and NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE is an equally impressive
listen. If haven't given Reeve a listen yet, I suggest you do now, for this
superhero knows how to turn the impossible into the inevitable, he knows how
to overcome, and this year, he may just know how to defeat the competition
and take home the 2003 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album... that is
unless Michael J. Fox gets lucky again!
