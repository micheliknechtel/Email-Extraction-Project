TODAY IN HEALTH HISTORY
=======================

Magnifying Life

On this date in 1949, two doctors saw something new.  Daniel C.
Pease and Richard F. Baker, both assistant professors at the
University of Southern California, used a regular electronic
microscope and a cutting technique they developed to magnify the
tissue of a fruit fly 120,000 times.  What they saw was a
spindle-shaped object 1-100,000th of a centimeter long and 1-1-
millionth of a centimeter wide.  It was the first sighting of a
gene.  The New York Times, at the time, reported that "the
observation ... is expected to be of great importance in medical
and biological research, particularly in connection with germs
and viruses."

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- People who are overweight at 40 are likely
to die at least three years sooner than those who are slim,
meaning that in terms of life expectancy, being fat during middle
age is just as bad as smoking, researchers say.

Diabetes Benefit Doesn't Offset Hormone Risk

therapy, a study concludes today.
