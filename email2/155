___| THE WEEK IN REVIEW |__________________________

By Ann C. Logue

Acquirers announced a smattering of Internet-related deals in the past week, with only seven deals making our review list. The week's largest deal was Nokia's $21 million purchase of Eizel Technologies, which develops software used to make Web content accessible on mobile devices. Nokia had joined with ITU Ventures to put up $4.2 million to seed the company in 2002.

Internet consultants and systems integrators, which have been in a consolidation mode, continued that trend in the past week. Wipro, an Indian firm that has been expanding by offering low-cost programming services, spent $18.7 million to acquire NerveWire, an IT consultant that develops Web applications and other services for financial services companies. In a smaller but more noteworthy deal, Form + Function, a Web and IT consultancy, announced that it was acquiring Divine/Whittman-Hart. Whittman-Hart was founded by Bob Bernard in 1984, merged with USWeb/CKS in 2000 to form MarchFirst, was sold to Divine Interventures in 2001 after MarchFirst failed, and now was sold back to Bernard as Divine struggles to remain solvent. 

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) properties also continued to be in demand. Verso, which sells switching and other tools for Internet-based integrated communications services, bought MCK Communications for $13 million. MCK develops technology used to migrate PBXs to Internet-protocol systems, which is especially useful for companies that have a handful of small, remote offices. Shiva, which specializes in Internet-based services for secure business communications, acquired Memotec, which offers IP services for replacing legacy voice and video networks within corporations.

MCK Communications develops products used to extend the functionality of a headquarters PBX system into a remote office. It has annualized revenues of approximately $12 million and $7.5 million in cash on the balance sheet.

This levers the existing investment in a legacy PBX. (Announc
