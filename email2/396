 Maze-Like Connection Games from your Board Games Guide
 http://glclk.about.com/?zi=10/76Z
 They're not mazes, they're games. But Twixt, great as it is, is a connection game with no maze-like elements. So exactly what are these games? Well, these are my picks for the best maze-like connection games.
 1. Take It Easy
 Not a particularly easy game to describe, Take It Easy involves colorful hexagons being places in such a way as to create as many straight, edge-to-edge lines as possible made up of the same color. Each player has the same chance at success; the trick is placing the hexagons as productively as possible. For one to eight players.
 http://glclk.about.com/?zi=10/76W
 2. Streetcar
 Players build a winding set of tracks from the starting station to the finishing station, trying to construct the quickest path for their own trolley. Streetcar bears some similarities to the game Metro. For two to six players.
 http://glclk.about.com/?zi=10/76X
 3. Very Clever Pipe Game
 The cards which are laid down to make up the board include a variety of black and white pipes. When a player closes off a section of his own color, he wins points. For two or four players.

 The Science of Secrecy
 About.com's Guide to Puzzles, Dave Fischer, takes a look at a fascinating new book that explains the making and breaking of codes from earliest times to the present day.
