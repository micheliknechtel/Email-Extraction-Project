ECOMMERCE TERM OF THE DAY:
 
object-oriented programming
A type of programming in which programmers define not only the data type of a 
data structure, but also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied
to the data structure. In this way, the data structure becomes an object that 
includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create 
relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit 
characteristics from other objects.
