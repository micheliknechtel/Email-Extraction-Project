SHIFTY CHARACTERS: On New Year's morning, two teenaged boys in Edmonton,
  Alta., Canada, tried to rob a pizza deliveryman -- of the pizzas he was
  carrying. They failed. They then jumped into the man's car and tried to
  steal it -- but they couldn't figure out how to drive a manual
  transmission. The duo then again tried to steal the pizzas -- just as
  the police arrived. They were both charged with robbery. A police
  spokesman noted "It's very early, but we may not see a more poorly
  thought-out robbery this year." (Edmonton Journal) ...And the race is
  on....

WHEN AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT: Hernando County (Fla.) Sheriff's Deputy
  Neil Sullivan was reading the paper and saw an article about the first
  baby born in the county this year. He recognized the father's name --
  David Jose Orama, 23, who was wanted on an arrest warrant. Sullivan
  drove to Spring Hill Regional Hospital and arrested him. "He did not
  resist," a spokesman said. "He knew we were looking for him." Before
  the arrest, Orama and his girlfriend were considering calling the
  newborn boy "Darie Newyear". (St. Petersburg Times) ...Now they're
  thinking "Ofta Badstart".

YOU'VE ALREADY HAD ENOUGH: Robert Tyrell, 45, owner of the 16th-century
  North Star pub in Steventon, Oxfordshire, England, stopped by to get a
  drink on New Year's eve. His staff refused to serve him. Tyrell stomped
  away but came back driving a bright yellow mechanical digger, using its
  shovel as a battering ram to knock through a wall. No one was injured
  in the resulting stampede for the exits. "He could have killed
  someone," said one regular, who was inside drinking, "but I must say it
  was a very novel way of calling time." (London Times) ..."Always
  remember that I have taken more out of alcohol than alcohol has taken
  out of me." --Winston Churchill, British Statesman (1874-1965)

TURNABOUT IS FAIR PLAY: When detectives in Portland, Ore., dug through
  the home trashcan of a female police officer whose ex-boyfriend was
  charged with drug possession, they found a used tampon -- and had the
  blood on it tested for drugs. Outraged, the 13-year police veteran
  hired a lawyer. "If the police will do this to a police officer, who
  won't they do it to?" the lawyer asked. "There were no signs on the
  garbage, 'Do not open. Do not trespass'," said Multnomah County
  Prosecutor Mark McDonnell. "There was every indication... she had
  relinquished her privacy [and] possessory interest" in her trash. Once
  trash is put out it's "abandoned in terms of privacy," agreed Police
  Chief Mark Kroeker. Fine, said a local newspaper, which raided the
  trash of the police chief, District Attorney Mike Schrunk, and Police
  Commissioner and Mayor Vera Katz -- and reported on what it found.
  Kroeker called the stunt "cheap" and stomped out of an interview. Katz
  went ballistic, calling the paper's actions "potentially illegal and
  absolutely unscrupulous and reprehensible." But Schrunk shrugged off
  the turnabout, asking the paper, "Do I have to pay for this week's
  garbage collection?" (Willamette Week) ...One man's trash is another
  man's Pulitzer Prize.

LAST WEEK, I mentioned that I was going to drop the company names out of
  the "Dispatched To" line at the top of the issues. Nick in Tasmania,
  Australia, responded: "I have always enjoyed this bit as a start to
  your newsletter that I have been subscribed to for five years now!
  Since True goes to 195 countries now, I assume there are some pretty
  obscure ones, and maybe in place of the workplaces you could put
  'Dispatched to x amount of readers in obscure country y...'. It might
  at least last for half a year? Ijust thought it would be a nice idea,
  because no offence, but 'Dispatched this week to 113,000+ readers in
  195 countries, it's...' is a little bland." I agree, and done! I think
  I'll widen it out a bit (from "obscure" countries), though. And it will
  be "at least" X readers, since many use web mail services with .com
  addresses, which obscures locations. In general, when you see (say) "41
  in Romania", it means that there are that many subscribers in that
  country's Top Level Domain (which for Romania is .ro).

  Christopher, with the 21st Air Force in New Jersey: "I just wanted you
  to know that when I was serving with Operation Deep Freeze (the ongoing
  Air National Guard operation that supports the National Science
  Foundation) at McMurdo Station on Ross Island in Antarctica, 'This is
  True' was part of a weekly ritual. There are a number of people in 'Mac
  Town' that still read you through their Internet mail there. I guess
  that means you're popular on all 7 continents." I knew that I had
  readers at various Antarctica bases, but I haven't heard from anyone
  there in a while. Thanks for the update -- I love hearing about readers
  getting TRUE in interesting spots.

I HAVE VERY OFTEN mentioned military readers over the years, including
  more recently those aboard ships at sea, thanks to their satellite mail
  connections. So I was a tad surprised to get this from Stan in Texas:
  "Please, Sir, will you do a special issue for the men & women, my
  siblings, that are about to go to conventional war and those now
  serving in the war on terrorism? Many of them have 'net access, even
  while deployed. I feel that something especially for them would be
  especially appreciated. I know from personal experience that every
  little bit of encouragement helps after you kiss the spouse good-bye
  and get 'in country'. I'm sure that my wife (disabled Viet Nam era US
  Army veteran) and my Dad (WWII US Navy combat veteran) would agree."

  I reminded Stan that I have often featured military units in the past,
  and "if I have any 'reason' to do so again (e.g., a letter from someone
  in the field), I'll do so" again. Sound good? Not to Stan it didn't. He
  replied: "Perhaps when the jack-booted hordes invade your personal
  space you will understand that you owe a debt to those that interpose
  their personal being between you and those who think that the
  expression of free thought is a bad thing. I understand that you have
  the typical civilian's appreciation for those that volunteer to protect
  your ungrateful buttocks. Had you a fiber of civility you would have
  responded appropriately. Good morrow to you. I shall not trouble your
  tiny mind further. It is my fervent desire that you rot in an hell
  appropriate to your lack of humane feelings."

  To be sure, I don't consider Stan, who bragged that he was "TSgt, USAF
  (retired from active duty at 20 years and 13 days of service in the
  greatest Air Force in the world I am eligible for recall to active duty
  for the balance of 30 years service, until 1 March 2008. I don't want
  any more campaign medals.)", to be ANY way representative of our great
  military. Rather, he is one of those "bad apples" that spoil the image
  of our armed forces not only at home, but abroad. What a sad example he
  sets for our all-volunteer servicemen and -women. But I don't want to
  sit here and rag on him -- I'd rather active military readers respond
  to Stan. Please drop me a note, preferably from your .mil address, for
  next week's issue. Be sure to say whether it's OK for me to mention
  your unit and location (or not!)

THERE ARE SOME READERS I correspond with a fair amount over time. Ian in
  the U.K. was one of them. I had a recent letter from him in my "use in
  an issue when needed" folder, in which he had written, "I'd like you to
  know that TRUE is one of the few things at the moment that provides a
  truly happy moment when it arrives; it *never* fails to induce a smile
  (and God knows I've needed a few over the last year or so). It may be
  your business, earning money to help you live, but it makes a
  difference you wouldn't believe. A very heartfelt (I'm shouting here)
  *THANK YOU*. You don't realise (no, you don't) just how much joy and
  light you bring to people's lives -- there's nothing like a good laugh
  at the world. Don't quote me -- I'll blush! Kind regards, Ian."
  Unfortunately, his wife sent me a follow-up this week: "I am vaguely
  aware that this is a service for which Ian pays. I thought you might
  like to know that Ian died suddenly on the 28th of December 2002 and
  that maybe you would like to pass on his subscription to someone else
  who may appreciate it." I told Paula about the fabulous correspondence
  I had with Ian, and I indeed applied the remainder of his paid
  subscription term to another reader who told me he couldn't afford his
  renewal, since he had been laid off just before Christmas. Ian's spirit
  lives on.

SANDY IN ILLINOIS: "The lady you mentioned in last week's newsletter who
  sent charcoal and GOOHF cards [as gifts] made me think of something you
  might enjoy. Just before last Thanksgiving my husband was sent to
  Kentucky on business. Making small talk with the lady in the office
  where he was updating computer equipment, he mentioned how much he
  would like to be able to get some really big lumps of coal to hassle
  our 3 teens at Christmas. Without giving it any more thought, he
  checked the computers, told her what to pack up and ship back to him on
  Monday. When the package arrived, it weighed a TON. In with the cords
  and discs was a grocery bag full of huge lumps of coal -- the size that
  barely fit in your hand! Seems the woman's husband worked for the
  railroad and coal is always falling off railroad cars on the slopes
  beside the tracks. He took a walk one afternoon and filled a bag for
  her. After Christmas, my husband called her and told her about wrapping
  them up for the kids -- even one for their dog!! I think they enjoyed
  being part of the joke as much as we did."

AND STEVE IN California: "I enjoyed meeting you and your wife at the
  Santa Ana Reader Gathering a few months ago. I signed up for the
  Premium subscription at that time, and have since been kicking myself
  in the pants -- why, oh why, didn't I sign up for this sooner? I've
  loved every issue; keep up the good work!" If YOU don't want to kick
  yourself for not getting double the entertainment that a Premium
  upgrade brings, upgrade now! Upgrades start at just 10 bucks, and you
  get about twice the number of stories the free edition has. We take

THIS WEEK'S HONORARY UNSUBSCRIBE goes to Jean Kerr. A writer, Kerr was
  known for dry wit about everyday life. "I write what I know," she said.
  In order to get away from her noisy family and write, she often went
  out to the car and drove several blocks away. "There is nothing to do
  but write," she once said, "after I get the glove compartment tidied
  up." Her first hit was the play "Touch and Go" (1949), and her 1961
  play "Mary, Mary" was a huge hit, running on Broadway for more than
  1,500 performances. But she is probably best known for her 1957 book,
  later adapted to a 1960 movie and then a 1965-1967 television series,
  "Please Don't Eat the Daisies". Kerr died from pneumonia on January 5
  in New York. She was 80.
