What You Need To Know About Fitness
 From Wendy Bumgardner, your Editor and Guide

 --------------------------- EDITOR'S NOTE ----------------------------
 When the weather outside is frightful - bring your workouts indoors. You can make an exercise spot in your own home or join the crowd down at the gym. Winter is a great time to start some strength training and ab work in addition to aerobic exercises such as running, biking, walking, skating and skiing.

 Best Ab Gadgets from your Exercise Guide
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/B9z
 Everyone wants washboard abs, but how do you get them? Losing body fat is key, but working your ab and back muscles to make them strong is important too. While you don't need special equipment to work your abs, there are some gadgets out there to help you add a little variety to the same old crunches.
 1. Fitness Quest Flexaball
 The exercise ball is by far my favorite tool for working the abdominals. This one comes with a video and a pump. Purchasing a ball is great idea because you can use it for a variety of exercises (not just abs!). Use it as a 'weight bench' to challenge your balance or sit on it while watching TV or working on the computer. You'll notice stronger abs and better posture.
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/B9w
 2. Bollinger Tone Up Wheel
 Bollinger's Tone Up wheel is exactly what it sounds like...a rubber tire and handgrips that you use to roll your body in and out to strengthen your upper body and your abs. This is one of the cheapest ab gadgets you can buy and it's great for strengthening the ab muscles that support your spine. You'll build endurance in your shoulders and arms, but watch your lower back when using it!
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/B9x
 3. Torso Track
 The Torso TracK is a more expensive ab gadget that works much like the wheel describe above. You use the handgrips to glide back and forth across the track which challenges the muscles of your abdominals and your back. Again, you also get a bit of an upper body workout as well.

 Beginners Running: 0 to 3 in 30 Days or Less
 You've finally decided that this New Year is going to be different! You're going to get up off the couch, go outside, and run that marathon that you've always dreamed of. Think of the glory. Not so fast, Champ! Here is how to get started, the slow but sure way.
