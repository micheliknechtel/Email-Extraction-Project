HERE'S WHAT'S COMING UP NEXT ON DAYS OF OUR LIVES: 

Belle lets out a blood-curdling scream when she stumbles 
upon Colin's dead body. Chloe and Brady leave the reception 
to be alone at the loft, as Isabella looks on. 

HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED ON DAYS OF OUR LIVES:

Larry slips into the mud room and Shawn/Belle discover the 
fireplace has been used and wonder if someone has been there. 
They go to get wood and Larry aims his gun at them, but Belle 
knocks out Larry and he falls unconscious. As Shawn builds a
fire, he sees Belle shivering and thinks they should go home. 
On the way out, he spots Larry's Santa suit and wonders if 
someone broke in. Larry emerges from the mud room and is glad 
he didn't shoot the kids because it would've compromised his 
plan to kill Bo. Colin fantasizes about his plan - after Sami 
tells him about Jennifer, Colin will step out of the shadows 
and push Jack over the cliff and everyone will assume a 
distraught Jack killed himself. Brandon finally concedes and 
gives Nicole the check. Nicole gets the tape, believing she's 
in the clear, but Colin says it's just beginning. Shawn/Belle 
meet and plan their special night together at the Salem Inn. 
Cassie sneaks a peek in one of Belle's bags and sees a negligee. 
Bo plans to check out the Horton Cabin before the wedding, 
unaware that Larry is hiding out there; Cassie vows she'll 
stop Belle and Shawn from making love once again. At Roman's 
house, he and Kate discuss their failed relationships and end 
up making love. Sami comes over and realizes Roman's with 
Kate; he can't help her with Colin, so she steals Roman's 
gun. Colin takes great pleasure in telling Jack that he slept 
with Jennifer. Brandon vows to stop Colin for hurting Nicole 
and Sami. Hope steps out onto the terrace for some air and 
overhears Colin on the phone, saying he intends to kill Bo. 
As Cassie pouts over Shawn, Rex urges her to get a life. Hope 
turns after hearing Colin say he plans to kill Bo and sees 
Larry standing there, gun in hand. She goes back into the 
mansion and stumbles into Shawn, covering her emotional 
distress. Bo assures Jennifer he'll bring Colin down for 
threatening Jack's life. Brandon is cornered by Fay, who 
gets him to admit he's upset with Colin; she urges him to go 
for a walk to clear his head, but becomes worried when he 
doesn't return in time for the ceremony. Nicole reads Colin's 
note and is furious that he plans to continue blackmailing 
her and still has a copy of their encounter on tape. Victor, 
who's been watching her, makes his presence known and asks 
about the note, but Nicole covers. He gives her a chance to 
come clean, but she doesn't; Bo interrupts, looking for Colin, 
and confides in Victor that Colin's been stirring up trouble. 
Victor tells Bo he'll handle Colin, but Bo is just as 
determined.

HERE'S WHAT'S COMING UP NEXT ON PASSIONS: 

Gwen tells Sheridan she doesn't trust Beth. Mrs. Wallace 
wants Luis to know the truth and prepares to expose her 
scheming daughter.

HERE'S WHAT JUST HAPPENED ON PASSIONS: 

Charity is upset about her break up with Miguel because of 
Kay's pregnancy. When Miguel arrives with Pilar at the Bennett 
home, Sam lashes out at him for hurting Charity. Sam also 
thinks that Kay is a rat for betraying Charity by sleeping 
with Miguel. Kay insists that she thought Miguel loved her 
when they had sex. Sam begins to buy into Kay's spin and 
apologizes for condemning Kay, but Grace doesn't believe Kay 
is telling the truth. Sam and Grace have a bitter argument 
over Kay. Sam feels Kay is the innocent victim of Miguel's 
seduction and lies, while Grace thinks that Kay deliberately 
set out to break up Miguel and Charity. Ivy takes advantage 
of the rift between Sam and Grace to get closer to Sam. Sam 
admits he can't help but feel anger towards Grace. Having 
waited all night, Sheridan believes Luis chose Beth over her 
and leaves in tears. Sheridan swears the judge's secretary 
to silence about her having been there, and goes home 
determined to put her relationship with Luis in the past. 
Meanwhile, Fox flirts with an untrusting Whitney. Grace 
lashes out at Kay for manipulating Miguel and hurting 
Charity. However, Charity comes to her cousin's defense. She 
explains to Grace she can't marry Miguel because it would be 
morally wrong to do so. Kay is confident she will marry him 
instead. Charity and Miguel try to put on brave faces despite 
their agony.
