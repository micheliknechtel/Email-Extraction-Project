Videos to Plan Your Summer By =20
We=92ve just received several copies of  video tapes that combine Alaska =
Magazine Television=92s coverage of our Brooks River Trip, our Talstar Lo=
dge Fly Fishing School, and our August trip on the prolific Aniak River i=
n August. In fact, there are two episodes of the AMTV=92s coverage of Ani=
ak. They had such a great time with us they just couldn=92t seem to stop =
filming. One episode is all about Woody Wooderson, of Hook-M-Up Tours, ou=
r outfitter for the trip, and the other is about a woman who gets started=
 fly fishing among the salmon, char, Arctic grayling and rainbows on that=
 super trip.=20

If you=92re considering joining us for any of these trips and would like =
to view the tape, just drop us an e-mail and will mail one off for you to=
 look at and return. You=92ll really get a good idea of the water, the pe=
ople, and especially the fish on these great trips.

shing as a girl. Please drop us an e-mail to let us know a little about y=
our fly fishing history.=20

Question & Answer=20
Question: What is the best all-around sink-tip fly line if you can only a=
fford to buy one?
Answer: Most fly fishers agree that if you can only have one sink-tip fly=
 line then it should be one that has a 12-15-ft long sinking tip with an =
intermediate sink-rate.
(Send us your questions and we=92ll answer one of them in this section ea=
ch month.)

Now, here=92s the answer to our earlier =93Did You Know?=94 question-- Th=
e two most famous women in the IGFA Hall of Fame are Dame Juliana Berners=
 and Mary Orvis Marbury. You knew that, didn=92t you?

Go fishing if you can, and remember, =93to fish is human; to release divi=
ne.=94 I look forward to seeing you in Washington and California at the s=
hows.  Pudge
