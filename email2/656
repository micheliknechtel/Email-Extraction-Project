Good Morning,
Checking out the technology section on one of my favorite 
web sites this morning, I saw that there is a Caribbean 
Island up for sale on eBay. The minimum bid is only 3 million 
dollars for the whole island or 1 million for a segment. 
Ahh...to dream! I wonder what eBay will start selling next?

Until Tomorrow,
Erin

			PRESSURIZED

Toilets seem to work according to the principle that they 
leak and don't flush properly whenever you really need them 
not to leak and perform an "oh, please take this away" flush. 
Well, not really. Actually, they work on some pretty sound 
principles of fluid dynamics. If you use the phrase "fluid 
dynamics," of course, you will betray your lack of knowledge 
to the plumber as you try to describe what is wrong with the 
"throne." Better to stick with, "it just won't go down!"
In the traditional home toilet, the box on the back of the 
stool holds water. When you flush, the flush valve in the 
bottom of the tank opens and allows the whole tank-full of 
water to rush down the drain hole. As this rush of water 
passes the hole that goes into the bowl, it creates a vacuum 
that can pull the water in the bowl along with Barbie dolls 
and toy tugboats down the drain. Some additional water 
remains to rinse the bowl and re-fill it. 
The latest water-saving device comes in the form of the 
pressurized (power flush) toilet. Users of early models 
of the power flush are well-acquainted with the roar 
associated with flushing. Later models are far tamer and 
quieter. 
What's going on inside the tank is the key to the power flush. 
A reservoir is filled and pressurized through a fill valve. 
When the flusher is activated, all this pressurized water 
just works a traditional toilet, except at high velocity. The 
theory is that you use less water, which is true. How powerful 
is it? Well, let's just say your bowling ball could be at risk. 
You also pay a bit more for the toilet, but that is the price 
of progress.
Can't get enough info about this wonder of modern technology? 
Just about everything you would want to know can be found at

too -- one link will show you how to build an outhouse.

		SINGLE PROTEIN SETS BIOLOGICAL CLOCK

A husband and wife research team from Purdue University has 
discovered our biological clock is a single protein that 
times out periods of activity and inactivity within cells. 
D. James and Dorothy Morre say if the protein is altered the
body will experience days of different length -- ranging 
from 22 to 42 hours. "Since the clock affects nearly every 
bodily activity, this discovery holds myriad potential 
applications, from minimizing jet lag to determining when 
best to administer cancer drugs," James Morre says. The Morres 
found cells enlarge for 12 minutes, then rest for 12 before 
growing again. James Morre theorized some undiscovered 
proteins were responsible for the 24-minute growth cycle. 
The team found a single cylinder-shaped protein molecule 
regulated the cycle. "Our model is that of a Janus-head protein 
with two opposing faces," he said. "One 'face' handles cell 
enlargement. Then the protein 'flips over,' allowing the 
second face to carry out other activities while cell 
enlargement rests.


 		FROZEN CARBON DIOXIDE ON MARS

University of Melbourne geologist Nick Hoffman has found 
what could be the first active flow of fluids through gullies 
on Mars. Recent gully and channel development has been 
discovered near the polar regions from images taken by the 
Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. Many scientists theorize the 
gullies were carved by liquid water but Hoffman says the 
channels he identified from the Surveyor images more likely 
were carved by avalanches of carbon dioxide and associated 
debris. "The consequences of this for life on Mars are 
shattering. If similar mechanisms are responsible for all the 
recent gullies on Mars then the near surface life NASA is so 
desperately searching for may not exist," says Hoffman. Hoffman 
says in the Martian spring, when carbon dioxide frost and snow 
at temperatures of minus-130 degrees Centigrade still fill the 
valleys, flow events occur, cutting through the frost at 
temperatures that would "turn battery acid into building 
stone." He says nothing based on water could flow at those 
temperatures "so the culprit must be defrosting carbon 
dioxide."

		   FOREST POLLUTANTS OFFSET

Carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons emitted from agricultural 
forest trees are each pollutants but together they offset 
each other somewhat to lessen air quality problems. Researchers 
at the University of Colorado at Boulder say carbon dioxide, a
factor in greenhouse warming, reduces "agriforest" emissions of
hydrocarbons. Researcher Todd Rosenstiel says commercial
agriforests made up of trees including poplars, Eucalyptus 
and Acacia emit high levels of isoprene, a highly reactive 
chemical species believed to contribute heavily to ground-based 
ozone. He is cautious, however, because the effects of CO2 are 
unpredictable and the bigger picture is the rapidly growing 
number of agriforests worldwide emit hydrocarbons like isoprene 
in much larger volumes. The research suggests it could be 
possible to genetically engineer environmentally friendly 
poplar trees by lessening their isoprene output.


		BLACK HOLE HAS FREQUENT OUTBURSTS

New views from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory show the Milky 
Way's central black hole is a bad boy -- prone to frequent
outbursts and occasional large explosions. The observations of 
Sagittarius A -- or Sgr A -- occurred over two weeks and covered 
164 hours. During that time Sgr A flared up in X-ray intensity 
half a dozen or more times. Astronomers also found evidence that 
suggests it had an even more boisterous past. "We are getting a 
look at the everyday life of a supermassive black hole like 
never before," said Frederick K. Baganoff of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. "We see it flaring on an almost daily 
basis." The cause of the flares is not understood but the 
rapidity indicates they occur near the event horizon, or point 
of no return, around the black hole. Also, the intensity of the 
X-ray emission is relatively weak, suggesting Sgr A, weighing in 
at 3 million times the mass of the Sun, is a starved black hole. 
"Although it appears to snack often, this black hole is 
definitely on a severe diet," says Baganoff. "This could be 
because explosive events in the past blew away much of the 
gas from the neighborhood of the black hole."
