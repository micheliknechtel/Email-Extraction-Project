Hi everyone - hope all are well. Two new additions to TemariKai 
(www.temariaki.com)...
There has been enough continued interest on using stranded floss in 
Temari making - remember that this is not only for something like DMC or 
Anchor embroidery floss but also many of the specialty thread flosses. 
So, I've added a page with the collected info from gals on TalkTemari as 
well as webreaders that have sent in tips - and to that end, the floss 
hints that were on the general hints and tips page are now also 
consolidated on this new page.
Find the Floss Help page in the Help and How section   - and as always 
if you have aomething to share drop a line and we'll add it in. 

And, in response to many requests for ideas on displaying a temari 
collection (versus individual temari) there is also a page of Display 
Ideas in the Inspiration section. Likewise if you have anidea to share  
I'll be glad to add it.

And - since it appears that unfortunately we need to bear this in mind 
again, or more so than we have had in the last few months - the Keeping 
Vigil page is still active on TemariKai and I invite you all to be aware 
of it.... and for any of us with loved ones or acquaintances in the US 
or coalition armed forces being deployed to the Middle East and other 
staging sites - please drop me a line so that we may uphold you in 
thought and prayer. You need not divulge names if you care not to or 
can't, - and need not be specific in any way that would compromise 
security (we'll work it out) - email me at gthompson@temarikai.com - and 
whether you choose share with this or not, know that the thoughts and 
prayers are with you and yours.

That's it for now - keep the faith,
Ginny
