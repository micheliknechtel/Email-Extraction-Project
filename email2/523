I) Fixed Rates 

30 year conforming*  0 point   6.000%  
15 year conforming   0 point   5.375%

30 year Jumbo  0 point  6.125%  
15 year Jumbo  0 point  5.625%

5 year fixed Jumbo no points    5.5% 
5 year fixed conf. no points    5.125%

If you are concerned about closing costs, consider, also, 
these "no cost" options:

30 year fixed conforming (loan amount >$175,000 and 
<= $322,700      6.25%

30 year Jumbo  no cost  6.625%

*"conforming" is less than $322,700 for a single family home. 
Prices above are for 45-day rate locks with impounds. Rates are 
subject to change and rates, APRs, and closing costs can be 
ascertained from the web site:

II)  What's Happening

The technicals still indicate high volatility - the 
possibility of a large move in either direction.  The 
next few weeks are prone to large swings.

The BLS Employment Situation Report showed 101,000
fewer jobs in December. Some of this is due to 
seasonal corrections which allowed for a surge
in retail positions which did not occur.  In any case,
the economy still has the "blahs".


III) Tax Cuts?

I wrote a sizable check this week to the US Treasury 
Department for my 4thQ estimate taxes so the issue
of taxes became more than academic.

On Tuesday Bush introduced his tax cut.  The Democrats
have an alternative.  Neither is very imaginative.

Tax cuts will stimulate the economy in the short-term
which, I guess, is all that politicians care about.

What would have been much better is investment tax
credits geared to seed the growth of the economy of the
future.  The problem may be two-fold:  1) no one
has a good handle on what the growth industries of
the future really are and 2) past efforts to target
sectors for fiscal stimulus have proved spotty, at
best.  

A few weeks ago I wrote about targeting a hydrogen-based
economy for investments tax credits but clearly we are
not ready for it.  To some extent there are underlying
technical problems but, more than that, there is not 
broad-based knowledge or support for this.  Too few
people even know than you can produce energy from
hydrogen.  Arguing for hydrogen-base economy becomes
akin to arguing for Esperanto.  May be a good idea
but ain't gonna happen.

It is easy to blame politicians for promoting whatever
gets them elected but, to a significant extent, if
that's what the voters want that is what they will 
get.  So we will have Joe Millionaire on TV, McDonalds
hamburgers and the kind of politicians that we have.

So, sadly, we are left with a couple of tired old
tax cut packages.  The presumption, I think, is that 
the Bush plan will result in more investment because 
the elimination of the tax on dividends will return 
would-be tax receipts to a wealthier set of folks 
who are more likely to invest it than spend it.
There is an underlying flaw with this seemingly
intuitive notion.  The IRS reports that dividend
income is (roughly) divisible into 5 quintiles.

The following is a table of range of adjusted
gross income and total dividend income:

Income                  Total Dividend Income
0-$50,000               $26.9 billion
$50,001-$100,000        $27.1 billion
$100,001-$200,000       $23.8 billion
$200,001-$1,000,000     $29.3 billion
$1,000,001 and up       $25.4 billion 

The thesis that elimination of tax on dividends is going
to result in big investment dollars seems, to me, shaky.
An underlying reality is that stocks are no longer owned
by the rich but by the 401K's of the middle class.  The 
notion that the elimination of a tax on dividends will
benefit solely or mainly the rich is not based in reality.

One might conclude that the two tax-cut packages are about
nothing more than posturing for the 2004 election.  We 
deserve better.

My underlying assumption is that consumer spending is
still doing fine and an "across the board" tax cut
is geared to stimulating consumer spending. 

The real question, I think, is this:  assuming that the
federal government is going into the hole, is it better 
off (economically) for the government to keep taxes where 
they are and to increase spending and hope that government
spending will stimulate the economy?  More succinctly:
can the federal government spend dollars more wisely
than consumers?

A sad fact is that we really do not know the result of
changes in the economic forces of taxation, spending and
interest rates.  I really do believe that we are gaining
a better understanding of economics, fiscal policy and
interest rates.  We are not yet to the point where we
know exactly what dose of what drug the economy needs.

For myself, my background in science disposes me to the 
belief that what is needed is a large investment in basic
physics research.  A real understanding of the nature of 
energy and matter (the provenance of physics) might lead to
a permanent solution to the energy issue and a whole lot more.
Economic activity consists of work. Work is force times distance.
Energy is the ability to do work.  We need new sources of
energy and the manner in which they will be discovered is
through basic physics research.

There are (at least) three problems with this: 1) it is not 
like "going to the moon" it is a lot more amorphous than
that.  The public can understand what going to the moon is
but they do not know what the difference between fission 
and fusion is and they have never heard of superstring theory
and 2) the people who understand science and what are 
its possibilities are, by their nature, not the sort of folks
who understand how to muster political force for their
own interests 3) the last time something like this was done
was the superconducting supercollider which turned into 
a political disaster. Read this article about the history of 
the superconducting supercollider:
http://www.psncentral.com/research/SSC.htm

My advice: next time we have a large-scale project, locate
it in Wyoming.
