WELCOME

   When I got back in town from being with my family for two
   weeks over the holidays, I was met by a large stack of mail,
   most of it bills. I quickly opened each one to peek at the due
   dates, and when I got to my credit-card bill, I took a deep
   breath and peered at my balance due through squinty, grimacing
   eyes. Now is when we face the harsh reality of all those gifts
   we lovingly gave last month.

   If you, too, find yourself grimacing at your credit-card bill
   this month, check out this week's featured article, "Surviving
   the Splurge." The author, previously a credit-card abuser
   herself, offers five great tips to help you get your spending
   under control.

   Speaking of harsh realities, while I was opening all those
   bills, I had the TV on in the background and heard on one of
   those nightly Hollywood/entertainment programs that there are
   six new reality TV shows debuting this week. Six! With that in
   mind, we want to know if you've ever been hooked on any of
   these increasingly popular shows. Go to this week's poll on
   any page at the Women's Channel to let us know about your
   viewing habits.

   Also, don't miss the Best of 2002 section our parent site
   compiled, featuring the top news stories, most-read articles
   from Today's Christian Woman and our sister publications, and
   the top Christian music artists and albums from the past year.
   Go to Also @ ChristianityToday.com below for the link to this
   great feature.

   We pray you have a wonderful week!

   Blessings!

READ ALL ABOUT IT

   SURVIVING THE SPLURGE
   How to get out from under holiday debt--and stay out!
   by Katrina Baker

   I stared at our credit-card bill in amazement. Did I really
   spend that much money last month? I recognized several
   transactions for Christmas gifts, but I didn't remember making
   all those purchases. As I scanned the itemized statement, I
   realized some things I'd bought I hadn't even used yet! Other
   purchases were for eating out--the food was gone before it was
   paid for. Farther down the statement, I recognized many of the
   vendors' names as the titles of mail-order catalogs I love to
   browse. I guess I was doing more than browsing.

   I sighed as I remembered my New Year's resolution: Spend less
   money. Luke 12:48 reminded me, "From everyone who has been
   given much, much will be demanded." Although our family wasn't
   rich, we did have more than many people in this world, and I
   knew God expected me, as the bill-payer in our family, to
   manage our money responsibly. I realized I'd disappointed him
   by being a poor steward of the resources he'd given me.

   I decided right then things had to change. I had to pay off
   this credit-card bill. But the deeper issue was my need to
   change a lifetime of habits. How could I put a stop to
   uncontrolled spending?

   Through conversations with other women and time in prayer,
   I've discovered several basic yet effective strategies to get
   my spending under control. To be honest with you, it's not
   always easy. I'm still often tempted to spend with abandon.
   But by consistently focusing on the following techniques, I've
   been able to curb excess spending and get on the path to
   reasonable financial management.
