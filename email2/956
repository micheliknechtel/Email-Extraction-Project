I am using MOJO http://mojo.skazat.com/  as my e-list program. I am
interested in learning what the best distribution method of an ezine list
containing 2000 subscribers. I'm being given choices, on how my ezine is
distributed, and I don't understand what they mean or what would be best.
I'm hoping some folks on this list can help "teach me".


Choice #1 is ....
Send E-mail Using SMTP send all e-mail from Mojo Mail using a straight SMTP
connection instead of through a mail program such as sendmail.


Choice #2
Enable Batch Sending You must enable batch sending for batch sending to
start working.  Lists under 100 people may not need it at all.

Then my choices are
Send  "number of messages I want to send out at at time"
Every "interval of seconds I want the messages sent out".

Thanks in advance for your help with this.
