** BONUS ARTICLE ** 
=================================== 

DIFFERENTIATE YOURSELF 
By Michael Angier 

Competition is a fact of life in business. It's 
good for the economy. It's good for customers and 
it's good for us as business owners and managers. 
It keeps us constantly improving our products and 
services. It hones our skills and stretches our 
imagination. All very positive. 

But just how can we compete effectively? 

The best way to compete is to differentiate ourselves-- 
to stand out from our competition because of the unique 
gifts and special style we bring to the marketplace. 

Sometimes this can be done by being first. Xerox did 
it in copiers. Kleenex did it in tissues. They're not 
generic names, but these trademarked products have 
become almost generic and they stand out because they 
were well positioned. 

For most of us, this differentiating factor is not 
within our reach. If we can't be first on the market, 
we're forced to do something else. 

So how do we do this? 

First, we must know what our unique assets are. This 
takes some soul-searching. It takes some thinking. 

What do we do best? What do we love doing? Where 
have we received the most tribute? 

Are we faster, less expensive, more responsive, cleaner, 
lighter, hipper? Are we friendlier or easier to do 
business with? 

If we're not any of these things, we can reinvent ourselves. 
We can DECIDE what we want to be known for. 

But don't try to be something you're not. This reinvention 
should really be a discovery of latent values and 
qualities--things that were always there but rarely 
exploited. 

Once we're clear on who we are and what we stand for, 
we must take every opportunity to show people what 
we're all about. We must tell our story, tell it well 
and tell it often. The ideal is to get other people 
telling our story. 

Most of this is just common sense. It's just not very 
common. Southwest Airlines and Jet Blue are about the 
only airlines making any money these days. What's their 
secret? 

Well, Southwest is known for low fares, friendly people 
and fun flights. Jet Blue is known for new planes (all 
the same type), video screens in every leather seat, 
low fares and friendly service. 

They're known for this because they deliver on this 
reputation day in and day out. And they're good at 
telling their stories well. There's good buzz about 
what they do, how they do it and how well it's working. 
People rave about their experiences flying on these 
airlines. 

This isn't rocket science, right?  No wonder they're 
turning profits when others are declaring or trying to 
emerge from bankruptcy. 

Besides having a clear vision, mission and purpose, there's 
probably nothing more important for you to do to compete 
effectively than differentiating yourself. 

Of course it must be done with substance and based upon 
your core values. And it also must be backed up with 
commitment. With everyone paying attention to what's 
important, it will permeate the entire organization. 

You'll be known for what you want to be known for. You'll 
have more fun doing what you do best. You'll serve 
your customers better. You'll stand out and step up your 
profits and your fulfillment.
