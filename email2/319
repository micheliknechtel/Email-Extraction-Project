 (1) GAO Recommends Greater Collaboration Among Charitable
         Organizations in Future Disasters

 A new report from the General Accounting Office
 ( http://www.gao.gov/ ), the investigative arm of Congress,
 recommends that the Federal Emergency Management Agency
 ( http://www.fema.gov/ ) begin working with major charities
 to improve the way contributions intended to help victims
 of large-scale disasters like the September 11 terrorist
 attacks are collected and distributed, the Associated Press
 reports.

 According to the GAO report, a lack of coordination among
 charities in the days after the September 11 attacks led
 to confusion among aid recipients, many of whom were
 bewildered by the maze of service providers and intimated
 by the attendant paperwork and bureaucracy. The report
 adds that the situation improved over several months, as
 large charities and relief agencies worked together to
 coordinate their activities and client databases.

 "Charities can learn many lessons from the events of
 September 11th," said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-IA), who
 requested the report. "By working together to pool infor-
 mation and resources, I believe charities can do an even
 better job at helping those in need."

 (2) Kaiser Family Foundation Collaborates with Viacom to
         Launch Campaign Against HIV/AIDS

 The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation
 ( http://www.kff.org/ ) in Menlo Park, California, and
 media giant Viacom Inc. ( http://www.viacom.com/ ) have
 launched a new media campaign to combat HIV/AIDS with
 public service announcements, television and radio
 programming, and free print and online content about
 the disease and its prevention.

 The KNOW HIV/AIDS ( http://www.knowhivaids.org/ ) campaign
 will combine the public health knowledge of the Kaiser
 Family Foundation and the broad reach of Viacom's media
 brands to educate the general population about the impact
 of AIDS globally and to promote prevention and testing
 among higher-risk populations, including young people
 under the age of twenty-five, people of color, women,
 and men who have sex with men. Several creative agencies
 have developed the campaign's twenty-two television spots,
 fourteen radio ads, and thirteen outdoor ads, all of which
 will be offered rights-free to other media and inter-
 national broadcasters. In 2003, the campaign will place
 ads worth about $120 million on Viacom's broadcast networks,
 CBS and UPN, and on several of the company's cable networks,
 including MTV, VH1, and Nickelodeon.

 "Viacom's brands are cultural trendsetters like no other,
 with strong and loyal ties to the people we're trying to
 reach," said Viacom president and COO Mel Karmazin. "Our
 mission is to inform people and compel them to act -- to
 protect themselves, and get tested for the virus. We hope
 other media companies around the world will join us in
 fighting this epidemic with the most powerful communica-
 tions tools that exist -- their television, radio, outdoor,
 newspaper, magazine, and online assets."

 In addition to support from Viacom and the Kaiser Family
 Foundation, the campaign has received funding from the
 Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
 ( http://www.gatesfoundation.org/ ), the Mel Karmazin
 Foundation, and Viacom chairman and CEO Sumner Redstone.

 (3) Ford Foundation Announces New International Fellows

 The Ford Foundation International Fellowships Program
 ( http://www.fordifp.net/ ) has announced the selection
 of 407 new fellows from developing countries to receive
 support for up to three years of graduate study in a
 university program.

 Selected from a pool of more than 10,000 applicants from
 twenty-two countries and territories, the winners were
 chosen based on their academic achievement, commitment
 to the development of their communities and countries,
 and strong leadership skills and potential. The program,
 which was launched in 2000 with a $280 million grant from
 the Ford Foundation ( http://www.fordfound.org/ ), has
 named a total of 691 fellows since June 2001 and plans
 to select some 3,000 by 2010. The most recent group
 includes fellows chosen for the first time from the
 countries of Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, Mozambique,
 Palestine, the Philippines, and South Africa.

 "These IFP fellows represent a new generation of leaders
 whose perspectives rise from diverse communities and
 grassroots realities," said Ford Foundation president
 Susan V. Berresford. "The fellows are linked by their
 commitment to apply their further education to promoting
 human development and social justice in their communities
 and countries."

 The program, an initiative of the International Fellow-
 ships Fund, an independent supporting organization of
 the Institute of International Education
 ( http://www.iie.org/ ), works closely with local
 committees formed by IFP international partner organ-
 izations and Ford Foundation officials in Africa, Asia,
 Latin America, the Middle East, and Russia to choose
 fellows from groups and communities that lack systematic
 access to higher education.

 (4) Large Donations in Silicon Valley Shift from Stock
         to Cash

 During the economic boom of the 1990s, charities in
 Silicon Valley frequently received charitable gifts of
 stock. But with the collapse in stock prices that began
 in the spring of 2000, donors have all but stopped giving
 equities and are donating cash instead, the San Jose
 Mercury News reports.

 "All we are getting is cash," said Karen Bradley-Follette,
 vice president of development and marketing at the
 San Jose-based Community Foundation Silicon Valley
 ( http://www.cfsv.org/ ). According to Bradley-Follette,
 at least 90 percent of the donations received by CFSV in
 2000 came in the form of stock -- a ratio that lately is
 almost reversed. Donors tend to favor gifts of stock when
 share prices are high because they receive a charitable
 deduction based on the sale price of the stock, as opposed
 to its purchase price. Conversely, when the price drops,
 it reduces the value of the stock as a tax-deductible gift.

 But gifts of stock haven't completely dried up, says
 Ash McNeely, vice president of philanthropic services
 at the Peninsula Community Foundation ( http://www.pcf.org/ )
 in San Mateo. "Before, we'd see primarily tech stocks,
 IPO-related stock. Now we are seeing consumer product
 stocks, utility stocks, classic blue chip stocks."

 And while the foundation has seen its donations drop from
 $230 million in 2000 to $99 million in 2001 to $57 million
 in 2002, it has managed to award about $63 million to
 nonprofits in each of the last three years.

 (5) Faith-Based Grants Awarded to Groups Promoting
         Marriage

 As a result of the Bush administration's re-energized
 faith-based initiative, a number nonprofit groups have
 received grants from the Department of Health and Human
 Services ( http://www.hhs.gov/ ) to promote and strengthen
 marriage, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reports.

 In December, President Bush signed an executive order
 directing federal agencies to treat funding proposals
 from faith-based nonprofits as they would requests from
 secular groups -- a move designed to give faith-based
 social-service providers a better chance at securing
 government funding. At the same time, the president's
 order stipulated that federal funding awarded to such
 groups could not be used to "directly support inherently
 religious activities" -- a concession to members of
 Congress concerned that faith-based groups might use
 government funding to proselytize, thereby violating the
 constitutional separation of church and state.

 Earlier this month, HHS secretary Tommy Thompson announced
 grants totaling more than $2.2 million to a variety of
 religious, nonprofit, and tribal organizations in a dozen
 states, including $200,000 to the Marriage Coalition, a
 Cleveland Heights, Ohio-based nonprofit, to test a curri-
 culum over the next eighteen months for poor single
 parents that emphasizes the value of marriage and child
 support. The organization, which describes itself as an
 "inter-religious group of clergy, mental health profes-
 sionals, and individuals," eventually hopes to make the
 curriculum available nationwide.

 "We have no official relationship with a religious com-
 munity," said Sandra Bender, a clinical psychologist and
 marriage counselor who is executive director of the
 Marriage Coalition. "We are primarily providing skills
 for relationships. We want people to have the confidence
 and the skills that they can do it without just urging
 people that they can get married."

 Other recent marriage-focused grants from HHS include
 $177,373 to Community Services for Children Inc., an
 Allentown, Pennsylvania, group that works with church
 groups to provide marriage education and other services
 to unwed couples, and $200,000 to the Alabama Child Abuse
 and Neglect Prevention Board, which works to help poor
 single parents learn marital skills, improve their
 employment prospects, and increase child support payments.

 (6) Arts Center Receives $1 Million and Drops Donors'
         Names

 In conjunction with the announcement of a new $1 million
 donation to a Palm Beach, Florida-based visual arts center
 named their honor, Robert and Mary Montgomery have asked
 the center to revert to its original name, the Armory Arts
 Center ( http://www.armoryarts.org/ ), in the hope that
 the name change will help the center attract larger con-
 tributions, the Palm Beach Daily News reports.

 The nonprofit center, which has received more than
 $2.8 million from the Montgomerys since it was founded
 in 1987, was re-named the Robert & Mary Montgomery Armory
 Art Center in 1997. The center will continue to honor the
 Montgomerys by adding their names to an historic 1939
 classroom building on campus.

 "In our discussions with Bob and Mary, we've talked about
 our not being able to attract large donations," said Jane
 McGregor, chair of the Armory board. "The feeling is that
 having [their] names attached to the campus is a detriment
 to getting larger donations, because there wasn't a strong
 naming opportunity and some people perceived that the
 Montgomerys owned the Armory. By taking their names off,
 we leave opportunities open for larger donors."

 (7) Helen Bader Foundation Announces Grants Totaling
         $6.3 Million

 The Helen Bader Foundation ( http://www.hbf.org/ ) in
 Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has awarded ninety new grants
 totaling nearly $6.3 million for programs in the United
 States and Israel that focus on Alzheimer's disease and
 dementia, early childhood and youth development,
 education, economic and community development, and
 Jewish life and learning.

 The largest grant in this round of funding was a three-
 year, $1.2 million grant to the Helen Bader Scholarship
 Fund at the Milwaukee Jewish Federation
 ( http://www.milwaukeejewish.org/ ) to provide tuition
 assistance to students attending the five Jewish day
 schools in the Milwaukee area. The contribution marks a
 20 percent increase in the foundation's support to the
 Fund, which has provided more than $3.7 million in
 scholarships since 1991.

 "Many families believe Jewish day schools reinforce
 their values, but they may be daunted by the cost of
 tuition," said Tobey Libber, the foundation's Jewish
 Life and Learning program officer. "The Fund is intended
 to keep the day schools within reach of the greatest
 number of families."

 greater St. Paul, Minnesota area, has announced 865 grants
 totaling $5.25 million, including thirty-seven grants
 with a combined value of $2.6 million from the foundation's
 unrestricted funds.

 Grants made by the foundation include awards of $250,000
 each to Twin Cities Public Television Inc.
 ( http://www.ktca.org/ ) to help fund the station's tran-
 sition to digital programming; the United Jewish Fund
 and Council ( http://www.jewishminnesota.org/ ), which
 works to unite, sustain, and enhance the Jewish community
 in St. Paul; and the Young Women's Christian Association
 of St. Paul ( http://www.ywcaofstpaul.org/ ).

 In addition, the foundation awarded $200,000 to the
 Guadalupe Alternative Programs ( http://www.gapschool.org/ ),
 a nonprofit organization that operates alternative high
 schools and provides adult education in St. Paul; $150,000
 to the Center for Victims of Torture ( http://www.cvt.org/ ),
 which offers treatment for torture survivors and their
 families; and $100,000 to the Community Reinvestment Fund

 (9) Spelman College Receives $2 Million from Lilly
         Endowment

 Spelman College ( http://www.spelman.edu/ ) in Atlanta
 has been selected as one of the thirty-nine colleges to
 receive funding from the Indianapolis-based Lilly
 Endowment to implement programs focused on religion and
 spirituality. The school, which was awarded a five-year,
 $2 million grant, is one of two historically black schools
 and one of two women's colleges to receive an award in
 this round of grantmaking.

 Spelman's new program, Sisters Center for WISDOM: Women
 in Spiritual Discernment of Ministry, aims to increase
 student, faculty, and staff awareness of and knowledge
 about religious vocations, spirituality, and ethical
 leadership; recruit and retain students pursuing the
 ministry as a vocation; expand the college's related
 course offerings; and establish connections with religious
 groups in the community. The program also is designed to
 increase research and scholarship on black women, religion,
 and spirituality and examine the gender-based disparities
 and inequities that have affected society and the church
 in the past.

 "Although women represent 75 percent of church membership,
 they are disproportionately represented in senior
 positions in the Black church," said Rev. Lisa Rhodes, a
 dean at the college. "The grant will enable us to develop
 programs that help students explore career choice and
 vocation as a calling, and religious leadership and
 pastoral ministry as a viable vocational option."
