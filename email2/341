Subject: Beat The Winter Blues With Nutricise!

Healthy Living Information and Weight Loss Counseling
January 8, 2003

When I woke up this morning the last thing I felt like doing was going to the gym, let alone getting out of bed. My incredibly skinny husband was cooking buttermilk pancakes in the next room with all of the fattening stuff on top. To make matters worse, he was threatening to serve me a whole stack of them! What was I supposed to do?

Well, I ate them, extra syrup and all. And then I realized that my New Year's resolutions were already on their way to the back burner, and that I needed to reaffirm my goals -- fast -- before my husband came around again to tempt me away from the treadmill with high-calorie treats. And so, if you're anything like me, you'll want to read along and find out how to beat the winter blues with motivational tips, fun workout and restaurant advice, and a very inspirational success story.

This week on Nutricise:

* BEATING THE WINTER BLUES
* POSITIVE IMAGE
* FIVE THINGS TO GET -- AND KEEP -- YOU GOING
* HAVE A CARDIO (BLAST): 10 MINUTES AT A TIME
* NUTRICISE'S HEALTHY CHINESE FOOD TIPS
