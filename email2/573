DOWNLOADABLE GOODIES

InDesign 2.0.2 Update--Revised

This revised version of Adobe InDesign 2.0.2 fixes a number of
installer-related issues that were present in the original 
InDesign 2.0.2 update that was available for download December 
4-5, 2002. Like the Adobe InDesign 2.0.2 update released last 
December, this revised update also addresses several issues 
identified in Adobe InDesign 2.0.1.  

The update is available online for all Roman languages for 
Windows

NOTE: If you installed the InDesign 2.0.2 update released last 
December, and you haven't encountered any installer issues, you 
don't need to install the revised update.
