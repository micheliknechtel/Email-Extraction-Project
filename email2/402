Quick Quote -- "That is going to be a turd on wheels."
                                  Tom Griswold on Lisa Marie Presley's 
debut album.

                        A police officer in New Zealand had to handcuff a 
sheep after
                        it attacked him.  He said it was the only way to 
keep the
                        animal from attacking him at least, that's the 
story he told
                        them when they found him with a handcuffed sheep."

                        Yes, alcohol kills brain cells, but it's very 
selective.  It only
                        kills the brain cells that contain good sense, 
shame, embarrassment, and
                        restraint.

The first ladies of UK, Japan and France were having a (aok)
meeting with Lady Hilary Clinton. The subject of discussion
was the penis of their respective spouse.

The first lady of UK says, "It is like a gentle man- it
stands up, as soon as I enter the room"

The lady from Japan says, "It is like an army officer- you
do not know where he will attack from- front or back.."

The French lady says, "It is like the screen in the
auditorium- once the act is performed, it drops down..."

Then Hilary says, "It's like a rumor... it moves from one
mouth to another..."

The doctor told me "Physical exercise is good for you." I know that I
should do it, but my body is out of shape, so I have worked out this
easy daily program I can do anywhere:

Monday:
Beat around the bush.
Jump to conclusions.
Climb the walls.
Wade through paperwork.

Tuesday:
Drag my heels.
Push my luck.
Make mountains out of mole hills.
Hit the nail on the head.

Wednesday:
Bend over backwards.
Jump on the band wagon.
Balance the books.
Run around in circles.

Thursday:
Toot my own horn.
Climb the ladder of success.
Pull out the stops.
Add fuel to the fire.

Friday:
Open a can of worms.
Put my foot in my mouth.
Start the ball rolling.
Go over the edge.

Saturday:
Pick up the pieces.
Whew!
What a workout!
You are invited to use my program without charge!!

       3) Moderate to high temperature.

A guy sees his best friend on the street. The friend is wearing a
flamboyant outfit. Lime colored trousers, a puff sleeved, lavender
shirt, a puce ascot, etc... So he asks his friend, "what in the world
is wrong with you?"

"Oh, my wife," the friend replies.

"Your wife?" queries the first guy.

"Yea. I saw an ad in the paper for Cox's Men's Store. They were
having a great sale on seersucker suits. So I told her, go to Cox's
and but me one of those seersucker suits. So what does she do? she
goes to Sears and buys me c___sucker suit."
