"My Big Fat Greek Wedding"
MPAA rating: PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)
Our price: $18.17 | You save: $9.78
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006FMUW/ref=mk_del_424517

"I had to go to Greek school, where I sat in a room translating, `If
Nick has one goat and Maria has nine, how soon will they marry?'"

--Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos) reminisces about her childhood in
"My Big Fat Greek Wedding." The biggest surprise hit of 2002 is

*************************************
"Signs (Vista Series)"
MPAA rating: PG-13 (Parental Guidance Suggested)
Our price: $19.49 | You save: $10.50
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JL3T/ref=mk_del_424517

While addressing crises of faith in the framework of an
alien-invasion thriller, M. Night Shyamalan (in his follow-up to
"The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable") favors atmospheric tension over
explanatory plotting.

"Simone"
MPAA rating: PG-13 (Parental Guidance Suggested)
Our price: $20.24 | You save: $6.74
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007G1YQ/ref=mk_del_424517

What do you do when you've discovered a new superstar... and she
doesn't really exist? That's the delightful premise of "Simone,"
another smart, provocative what-if scenario from writer-director
Andrew Niccol ("Gattaca," "The Truman Show").

"About a Boy (Widescreen Edition)"
MPAA rating: PG-13 (Parental Guidance Suggested)
Our price: $17.54 | You save: $9.44
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JL7Q/ref=mk_del_424517

A box-office smash in England, "About a Boy" went on to charm the
world as another fine adaptation (following "High Fidelity") of a
popular Nick Hornby novel. While "High Fidelity" transplanted its
London charm to Chicago, this irresistible comedy was directed by
Americans Chris and Paul Weitz with its British pedigree intact.

"The Bourne Identity (Widescreen Collector's Edition)"
MPAA rating: PG-13 (Parental Guidance Suggested)
Our price: $17.54 | You save: $9.44
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXXM/ref=mk_del_424517

Freely adapted from Robert Ludlum's 1980 bestseller, "The Bourne
Identity" starts fast and never slows down. The twisting plot revs
up in Zurich, where amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon),
with no memory of his name, profession, or recent activities,
recruits a penniless German traveler (Franka Potente) to assist in
solving the puzzle of his missing identity.

"Barbershop"
MPAA rating: PG-13 (Parental Guidance Suggested)
Our price: $20.24 | You save: $6.74
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006RVJR/ref=mk_del_424517

With enough lively banter to keep its customers happy for years,
"Barbershop" is a loose, lanky comedy with its heart--and its
humor--in all the right places. Ice Cube plays the reluctant heir to
his late father's barbershop on Chicago's South Side--a neighborhood
institution that seems like a trap for a guy with bigger dreams.

"Trouble in Paradise - Criterion Collection"
MPAA rating: NR (Not Rated)
Our price: $29.96 | You save: $9.99
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007CVS4/ref=mk_del_424517

"Trouble in Paradise" is the supreme example of "the Lubitsch
touch," that mastery of comic timing, diamond-cutter precision, and
continental sophistication that made Ernst Lubitsch a household name
and the real star of every movie he directed.

AN AMERICAN BEAUTY: CINEMATOGRAPHER CONRAD HALL (1926-2003)
***********************************************************
Some wonderful things have been said about Conrad Hall since he
died unexpectedly earlier this month. But you have to see his work
to appreciate this cinematographer, who could make each film frame a
work of art. Hall found modern reverence in black and white ( "In
Cold Blood"), made the Western glow ( "Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid"), created mood for a child playing chess ( "Searching
for Bobby Fischer"), and brought color to film noir ( "Black
Widow"). He could win his third Oscar® in March for his
stunning work in "Road to Perdition." Amazon.com interviewed Conrad
Hall in 1999 in conjunction with the release of "American Beauty,"
perhaps his greatest achievement.

		A box-office smash in England, <i>About a
						Boy</i> went on to charm the world as another 
fine adaptation (following
						<i>High Fidelity</i>) of a popular Nick 
Hornby novel. While <i>High
						Fidelity</i> transplanted its London charm to 
Chicago, this irresistible
						comedy was directed by Americans Chris and 
Paul Weitz with its British pedigree
						intact.<p>

						Bourne (Matt Damon), with no memory of his name, profession, or recent
						activities, recruits a penniless German traveler (Franka Potente) to assist in
						solving the puzzle of his missing identity.<p>

		With enough lively banter to keep its customers

loose, lanky comedy with its

places. Ice Cube plays the reluctant
						heir to his late father's barbershop on 
Chicago's South Side--a neighborhood
						institution that seems like a trap for a guy 
with bigger dreams.<p>
