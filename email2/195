Know Your Prescriptions

Looking for unbiased information comparing the effectiveness
of prescription drugs?  Oregon has just published the first
publicly funded unbiased source of information comparing the
effectiveness and safety of prescription drugs, and AARP
has a guide to understanding it all.

Brave the Rain in Seattle

Sure, it rains a lot in Seattle. But that’s no reason to
pass on a visit to this cosmopolitan city in the Pacific
Northwest.  Take a visit to the city that gave us gourmet
coffee, grunge rock and more.
