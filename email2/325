   Josh Hinds' Daily Commentary
------------------------------------------------------

Get More Personal - Most of you know that when you write 
me I always like to write back and show how much I 
appreciate the message. I do stay busy, but taking the 
time to write back is something that's very important to me.

Well friends, the other day I slipped up! (See even I can
admit my mistakes... lol. After all that's how we grow isn't
it?). You see I received a message from a person that had
two parts to it. The first part a very kind note letting me
know how much she enjoyed the newsletter while the second
part was asking about purchasing a sponsorship ad in the
newsletter.

I must have been in a bit of a hurry at the time so I only
wrote back regarding the sponsorship part of the note (I am
not making an excuse for myself here. Lack of time is simply
no excuse when building relationships... professional,
personal or otherwise. That's a rule you'll want to take to
heart I assure you).

When I first replied I didn't even realize that I had been
so hasty about it. Then luckily (I'll explain why it was
lucky in a second) the person wrote back to tell me that I
had not taken the time to give thanks and that I had only
mentioned the sponsorship part in my reply to her.

She went on to tell me that she understood, but did offer
the great advice that I should be a bit more personal. You
see, while that is exactly how I am virtually all the time,
it didn't matter because in this particular circumstance it
was my first correspondence with her, and she had no basis
for judging me except by this first impression.

You see, she had absolutely no way of knowing that I do try
to be personal. That was my job, and yours to portray with
the actions you show others. I love the saying, "Your
actions speak so loud I can barely hear the words you say".
Wow! how fitting is that to the situation I found myself in?

Looking back, I am so thankful that she took the time to
remind me. Had she not I might have slipped up again! (heck
I'm only human right? :) You see, folks in our busy hectic
day-to-day schedules we all get in a bit of a hurry. Maybe
you're selling a product (You are at least selling yourself)
and not even realizing it but you walk into a person's
office or house and jump right into your sales spiel.

If you do this I am certain that you're missing the boat!
People want to know us prior to doing business with us (or
extending a friendship to us as the case maybe). When we
first fill this basic human need we are in a much better
place with regard to being able to give them what they need.
Believe me, its a position that is worth putting forth the
effort to be in... Your friend in cyberspace, Josh Hinds
