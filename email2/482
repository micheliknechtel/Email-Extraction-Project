It's New! It's Hot! It's "Grandma's Cottage" Bedroom Collection

It's a very primitive look reminiscent of simpler times. With "worn" 
detailing, knots, and heavy distressing every piece of this collection has 
an individual character that your children's children will still be 
enjoying. (Perhaps that's why it's called "Grandma's Cottage!") Available 
in Antique Oak, Antique White and (for a really dramatic look) Antique 
Black. The collection will begin shipping in late February. We believe the 
first run will sell out quickly. Order now to avoid long delays.
