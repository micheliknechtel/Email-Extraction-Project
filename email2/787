      This week I present a recipe for South African Seed Bread..  It, =
like the Ballymaloe Brown Bread presented last week, is really easy to =
make.   Total time is only about 2 hours from start to finish.  Last =
week I forgot to mention that the molasses goes in with the water when =
making the bread dough.  I corrected the recipe on our website.

      South African Seed Bread





      This is a delicious, healthy bread, with lots of nutritious seeds. =
 It is really easy to make because it needs only one raising.  The bread =
is wonderful with butter, honey, and/or sesame or a nut spread.  I =
adapted the recipe from Ultimate Bread by Eric Treuille and Urusla =
Ferrigno.  You can make it with 100% whole wheat flour if you so desire.

              2 3/4 cups whole wheat flour
              3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of unbleached flour
              3 teaspoons dry yeast
              1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt
              1 2/3 cups water
              4 teaspoons honey
              3 tablespoons each of sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, =
flaxseeds, poppy seeds, and chopped walnuts and pecans, or other mixed =
nuts
              1 tablespoon milk

      Fit a food processor with the metal chopping blade, not the dough =
blade.  Add the flour, salt, and yeast, and pulse for a second or two.  =
Add the water, milk, and honey.  Pulse till a dough forms, then let =
processor run for 10 seconds to form a fairly coarse, sticky dough.  You =
want the dough to be sticky so the loaf will be moist.  Remove the dough =
to a bowl and pour the seeds and nuts over the dough.  Knead in by hand =
using a rubber spatula.

      Oil or grease an 8.5" x 4.5" x 2.75" loaf pan.

      Turn the dough out into the loaf pan.  Pat the top of the dough to =
smooth it out.  Cover with plastic wrap and a towel.  Let rise until =
doubled so the dough comes to the top of the loaf pan or a bit above it: =
 about 1 hour.=20

      Heat oven to 400=BA and bake for 30 minutes.  Turn oven down to =
350=BA and bake for 30 more minutes.  (Note:  if using a black or dark =
steel loaf pan, reduce heat 25 degrees for both temperatures.)    Turn =
loaf out of pan onto a wire rack to cool.  If you desire, you can insert =
an instant read thermometer in the bottom of the bread to test for =
doneness.  Most breads are done at 160=BA.  Immediately brush the top =
and sides of the loaf with the milk.

      The Tasmanian Meadow Honey tastes delicious on this bread.

         =20

      Helpful Equipment and Ingredients:

      Bounds Sea Salt Mill (#6026) - clear so you can see it has sea =
salt in it.  Grinds fast.  Comes loaded with sea salt from the =
Mediterranean Sea. Our favorite!  $20.00=20
      Baleine 26 oz Fine French Sea Salt  (#1584) for sprinkling.  $3.90
      Baleine 26 oz Coarse French Sea Salt  (#1585) for grinding.  $3.90
      Cuisinart Premier 14 Food Processor (#5230)  $299.99
      Oxo Angled Measuring Cups - eliminates the need to bring the cup =
to eye level. 1 cup (#6098) $4.90, 2 cup (#6099) $6.90
      Tree Spirit Spoon Spatula (#4424) - heat resistant to 43=B0 =
degrees, dishwasher safe, and only $7.00!
      Chicago Metalic Nonstick Loaf Pan (#NS15) - It is just $15.20.
      Instant Read Thermometer - 3 to choose from!=20
      Unfiltered Tasmanian Meadow Honey - (#1055) mild, delicate and =
smooth.  Tastes great on bread.  12 oz.  $7.50
