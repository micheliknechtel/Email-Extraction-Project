SIBLING RIVALS NOW FIND FAMILY BOND AS GAY ADULTS

DEAR ABBY: My two brothers, two sisters and I are not close. 
Our parents did everything possible to foster sibling rivalry, 
and as a result, we speak only a few times a year and rarely 
visit.

During the last few years, however, I have discovered quite 
a bit in common with my younger brother, "Randy." Among 
other things, we are both gay.

Randy recently asked me if I thought anyone from our family 
would show up if he and his live-in partner, "Jeff," were 
to hold a commitment ceremony. (Many members of our family 
belong to the Reformed and Christian Reformed churches,
both well-known for being unfriendly to gays.)

I am excited and happy for my brother. Would it be tacky 
ofme to ask him if I could be his best man? He may have 
friends he feels closer to, who have played a bigger part 
in his life, and I wouldn't want to make him feel pressured 
to include me. Should I mention it to Jeff -- a fantastic 
guy, by the way -- and see what he thinks? Or should I keep 
quiet? -- EXCITED OVER MY BROTHER'S BIG FAT GAY WEDDING

DEAR EXCITED: If I were you, I would take no chances on a 
miscommunication. Tell your brother how excited and happy 
you are for him and his partner, and that you would love 
to be a part of his commitment ceremony in any capacity he 
and Jeff see fit. (If he already has a best man in mind, 
perhaps you could do a reading.) Considering the dynamics 
in your family, your brother should be pleased by your
gesture of solidarity.

DEAR ABBY: I am an 18-year-old girl with a problem. I think 
I'm going crazy. For a couple of years now, I have been 
having strange thoughts. For instance, I believe there are 
people who can see me. I talk to them. (My family has over-
heard me talking to these "people." They can be acquaintances, 
famous celebrities or anyone.)

I don't hear their voices or hallucinate, but for some reason 
I just can't shake these "feelings." I do not use drugs of 
any kind. I have told my parents about this, but they tell
me I need to get out more, to serve others and take my mind 
off it.

I have done research on mental illnesses like schizophrenia 
and personality disorders, but I can't identify what's wrong 
with me. I want to see someone about this, but my parents 
think it's a bad idea. I love them and I know they care about
me, but when it comes to my problem, it seems like they want 
to ignore it and hope I'll grow out of it. Please help me. I 
am ... DESPERATE IN PARK CITY, UTAH

DEAR DESPERATE: You appear to be a very intelligent young 
woman. Although your parents might wish it, you and I both 
know that talking to people who aren't there and thinking 
they can see you is not behavior that will go away if you 
"get out more and serve others" to distract yourself. I urge 
you to contact your physician and ask for a referral to a 
mental health professional -- preferably a psychiatrist. You 
need more help than I can give you in a letter or newspaper 
column. Please don't wait.



ODE TO MYOPIA

My face in the mirror isn't wrinkled or drawn.
My house isn't dirty -- the cobwebs are gone.
My garden looks lovely, and so does my lawn.
I think I might NEVER put my glasses back on.
