BLUE MAN GROUP show tickets at the Luxor=2E This is one of=20
the best shows in Las Vegas and very hard to get great seats=2E=20
Highly recommended by billhere for ages 5 and up=2E
The problem with Blue Man Group tickets is that you

You also risk getting "PONCHO" seats in the first 4 rows and getting
wet! Or over-paying for the tickets through hidden service charges!
I am now able to get you excellent seating at great prices  with ALL
CHARGES AND TAXES INCLUDED=2E=20
I will e-mail to you the seating diagram for the theater AND let you
know EXACTLY where your seats are BEFORE you purchase tickets=2E=20
