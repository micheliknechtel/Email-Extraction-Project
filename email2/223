Hi Everyone!

It is now 6:45 am Friday morning. I had a few problems in the past
48 hours which caused a delay in working on the CJI report. 
I skipped the game tonight and just finished the report.
-------------------------------------------------------
Here are a few short web announcements before the jobs:

Unfortunately I had to add more pictures this week to the 
"We Should Not Forget" terror memorial
http://www.jr.co.il/terror/israel/index.html

May the memory of those that were killed be blessed.
May the wounded have a full and speedy recovery.
----------
I opened a new Israel Elections 2003 section on my website.
It includes links to information about the elections and
all party websites that I could locate.
The address is:
http://www.jr.co.il/hotsites/i-elect.htm
----------
On the J site I added Tu B'Shvat clipart and over 40 questions and 
answers to the  Jewish Trivia Database.
Two other Tu B Shvat J Site features include the Word Search 
game and My Hebrew Songboook.
http://www.J.co.il

There are now 70 Tu B'Shvat hotsites links on my site.
The address is:
http://www.jr.co.il/hotsites/j-hdaytu.htm

Enjoy!
-------------------------------------------------------
The Jewish Trivia Database now has 510 questions and answers.
On the last CJI report I asked readers to send a few
questions and answers that are not in the database. Out of
10,000+ subscribers, only 3 sent me email. I will attempt 
one more time:
If you would like to help out (please) in this global project
you can pick any of the 8 topics and send me 1 or 2 questions 
that do not appear already. 
Please send the topic, suggested level, question, correct answer 
and 3 incorrect (closely related) answers.
If possible (not required), please list a source of the information.
All it takes is 5-10 minutes of your time. I am sure that
many of you can think of at least 1 question and answer that
do not appear. Please check that they do not appear already at:
http://www.J.co.il
Thank You!! and !
-------------------------------------------------------
It is now Friday morning and I need to get a few hours of sleep
before doing some shopping.
Tu B'Shvat is in 8 days, so here is an early:
Have a Happy Tu B'Shavt!

Shabbat Shalom,
Jacob
