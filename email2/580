DO YOU OWN THE RIGHT STOCKS FOR 2003?
-------------------------------------

Dear Investor,

My name is Louis Navellier, and I want to offer you some FREE
advice to get you started right for 2003.

Here's why you should listen: According to The Hulbert Financial
Digest -- the industry's independent watchdog -- the aggressive
newsletter I started in the mid-1980s, MPT Review, has GAINED
2,899% in the last seventeen years (versus just 975% for the S&P
500). What's more, since I started my Blue Chip Growth Letter --
suitable for all, even conservative investors -- in late 1997,
our portfolio has BEATEN the S&P nearly 6-to-1.

FREE advice -- no obligation to buy anything. Advice tailored
specifically to the risks and opportunities in the market right
now.

THE RISKS
Please don't believe the Pollyanna crowd, telling everyone
who'll listen that the market is set to boom in 2003.

It's NOT.

I do believe the market will trend higher. But -- and this is
critically important -- just 15%-to-20% of all stocks will do
the "heavy lifting." Many more will stagnate. And the worst of
the bunch will drop like rocks!

Why?

Simple -- there's no traction in their business models. There
are still dozens of companies -- in tech, finance, retailing,
manufacturing and nearly every sector -- whose sales and profits
are in the toilet. And with a shaky economic recovery, their
prospects WON'T get better anytime soon.

I name the worst offenders in my NEW report "31 Big-Name Stocks
You Must Sell Now." Get it FREE immediately online by going here
now:

DON'T TAKE BIG RISKS
I provide regular sell-side advice to my Blue Chip Growth Letter
subscribers.

Back in March -- when many advisors proclaimed the bear market
dead -- I urged investors to dump:

- WorldCom (now bankrupt)
- Nortel (down 67% since)
- Williams Companies (down 86%)
- Tyco (down 44%)
- Bristol-Myers Squibb (down 43%)
- Flextronics (down 37%)
- AMR Corp (down 71%)
- and dozens more.

Now I'm warning you again, investors face more huge losses now
in stocks like these:

- 2 dominant retailers that have thoroughly messed up their
  winning formulas. Sell now!

- 7 widely-owned technology stocks that could still take years
  to recover. Get out before they plunge again!

- A pharmaceutical dinosaur; 2 once-golden brand names now in
  deep trouble; 3 American has-beens that once dominated world
  manufacturing; and more.

Stocks You Must Sell Now" FREE by going here now:

THE OPPORTUNITIES
The only companies you want to own now are those I call EARNINGS
MONSTERS.

At my Blue Chip Growth Letter, we own stocks with
rapidly-growing earnings -- and DUMP them when their businesses
start to cool off. That's how we were able to bank gains in EMC
Corp (+478%), Nokia (+252%), Cisco (+210%) and many others --
while most investors rode these stocks all the way back down.

In today's economy, true Earnings Monsters are few and far
between. But we own the best of the lot -- businesses that
dominate the competitive landscape -- at my Blue Chip Growth
Letter.

And I'll name two of my favorites -- "2 Top Buys for 2003" --
FREE. Just go here now:

YOURS FREE
This is my way of introducing you to the work I do at my Blue
Chip Growth Letter (maybe you'll give it a try some time).

Sincerely,

Louis Navellier
Blue Chip Growth Letter

P.S. 2003 will be a great year for those investors who: a) avoid
the most dangerous big-name stocks; and b) own those companies
with exceptional earnings growth.
