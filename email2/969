Hello. Gary Lockwood here again with more breakthrough ideas
and information on how to:
   Grow your business - Make more money - Have more fun.

First things first. If you are one of the 903 new subscribers who
joined us in the past month. Welcome! I'm delighted that you
have chosen BizSuccess Breakthroughs as a source of ideas,
inspiration and information. I'll do my best to live up to your
expectations.

And, "Thank *You*" for referring this newsletter to your friends
And colleagues. I really appreciate you for helping to pass the
word about this newsletter.

One other new thing. A few weeks ago, I was introduced to a new
kind of communication service. It has such an odd name, it caught
my attention...  "Zingback"

Zingback is the world's first interactive, proactive voice messenger
system - the voice equivalent of e-mail. Zingback is the only service
that calls your contacts, delivers your message (real-time) in your own
voice, and brings their reply right back to you

With one call you record your messages and schedule delivery times
for the individual (or groups!) you want to call.

Zingback tirelessly starts making your calls until it successfully
delivers
your message and requests a response. It's persistent.

Zingback does NOT leave a voice mail message! To the contrary, Zingback
"finds" each person and delivers your message live and in your own
voice!
If it doesn't find the person on the first try, Zingback tirelessly
seeks them
out 6 more times over the next 3 hours, all while you do something else!

Zingback prompts the listener for a response, then it brings their
replies
right back to you! Not a voice mail dead end or another endless round of
phone tag, it's a complete communication cycle.

Listen to the demo (at their website) - you'll see why this is so
fascinating.

I have arranged with the Zingback people for BizSuccess Breakthroughs
subscribers to get the first 30 days free. (This is NOT available their
general customers - it's a special deal and you'll need the code, below,
in order to get your FREE 30-day trial.)

Check it out for yourself. Go to their site, click on "Subscribe" and
fill in
all the info (yes, including your credit card info) and down the page
you'll
see two boxes that MUST have my codes to get the free 30 days.

The website is:    http://www.ZingBack.com

Click on the "Subscribe" option in the top-right corner.

Fill in the form and use my codes for your FREE 30-day trial:

Source Code = 8110
Promo Code = B25P

The regular price for the Zingback service is only $20 a month,
plus five cents per minute - about the same as long distance -
and just one sale or one critical message delivered to your your
committee or team could pay for this thing for years!

I'm still experimenting with this. Send me your ideas on how you use it.

Now, on to this issue of BizSuccess Breakthroughs.

Whenever you feel overwhelmed or frustrated by your business, it
means that you've gone as far as you can with current capabilities.

Seize the opportunity to increase your ability to accomplish your
goals faster and easier. Invest in yourself. My article for this issue
discusses the importance of investing in improvement. Enjoy!

If you want some help in putting them into practice, or if you
have questions, email or call me.

My hope is that you use the ideas and information in these
BizSuccess Breakthroughs broadcasts to get the results you
really want.

SUCCESS to You....
Gary Lockwood

           "Invest in Yourself"
           by Gary Lockwood

One of the best investments you can make is to invest in your
own professional development. Resolve to develop increased
capabilities  that will propel you toward your goals faster and
easier than before.

A new capability is something that gives you increased ability to
accomplish your goals. Whenever you are feeling overwhelmed or
frustrated by your business, it means that you've gone as far as
you can go with current capabilities.

As you move relentlessly toward the vision of your "preferred
future", you will need to create new capabilities along the way.
Capabilities that will empower you to be the top performer you
intend to be. You must not wait till you arrive three years in the
future and then realize you should have learned to be a top-notch
communicator, an outstanding negotiator or a high producing
salesperson.

Learning in today's fast-paced and ever-changing environment
can't be left to chance. Make a conscious effort to develop, grow
and learn or be doomed to repeat your mistakes. Worse yet, you
may habitually keep doing those things that are working for you,
while your competition is actively seeking new ideas, innovation
and growth.

Competitive advantage in today's world is based less and less on
technology. All of us have access to faster computers, portable
communication devices and information sources. The competitive
advantage of the future is your learning speed. Learning faster
allows you to react more quickly and satisfy your customers'
needs before your competitor.

Some examples of useful business skills are:
selling, negotiating, planning, financial management, delegation.

Each of these areas requires real-world action coupled with
adequate working knowledge.

Personal skills such as listening, learning, decision making,
influencing, time management and problem solving are also
critical to success. Notice how many of these personal skills
support business skills. For example, if you are a good active
listener you will be a much more effective salesperson.

Improving your business or personal life requires asking,
"If I am to arrive successfully at this new destination (my vision)
within three years, what new skills will I need and which of my
existing skills need to be improved or upgraded?"

You surely invest money and time in your enterprise to enhance
your technology, develop your marketing, and even outfit your
office. Yet, how much do you invest in yourself? How often do
you enroll in a class, buy a book, or hire a business coach?

Investing money and time to develop your skills and knowledge
has big payoffs. After all, you ARE the brains of the outfit, aren't
you?

When you are proactive about learning and improving instead of
just letting-it-happen, you accelerate your capabilities, expand
insight and experience startling advances in your thinking.

Invest in yourself. You're worth it. (and it's good for business!)

P.S.  I have openings for one new coaching client. If you are
ambitious, ready to tackle some big achievements, and are willing
to be accountable for the results you produce, let's talk.

Coaching is not cheap, nor is it easy. If you are in charge of your
life, ready to move quickly, and can afford to invest in your future,
contact me at (909) 739-7444 or at Gary@BizSuccess.com
