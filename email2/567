FROM LA TO SEATTLE
I was all geared up to get Herspace.com on a regular update schedule 
last year, only to find myself in a surprise move from Los Angeles 
to Seattle in August. It was for love!! And yes, I met him on the 
Internet, and yes, we are still together!! Now that I am settled in 
and not traveling as much, I will be tightening up the ship and 
bringing y'all more fresh, original content on a monthly basis. Woo 
hoo!!

WHAT THE FRELL IS FARSCAPE?!! AND WHY ARE THE FARSCAPE WOMEN SO COOL?
Only my favorite show, that's what!! And the source of a lot of buzz 
lately due to a premature cancellation by the Sci Fi Channel. My 
love of Farscape has a lot to do with its awesome women characters. 
See why this show beats Star Trek hands down, and make sure you turn 
on your TV tonight (Friday) to Sci Fi at 8 pm EST (probably, check 
your local listings) to see what all the fuss is about. For an 
analysis of the women of Farscape, see:

FREE TELECLASSES!
What better way to take a workshop than from the comfort of your own 
home? For these teleclasses, all you need is a telephone. At the 
appointed time, all you do is call a special number called a "bridge 
number" to join the class. All current classes are 100% free - all 
you have to pay for is the cost of the long-distance call. We had 
some problems with the bridge last year but it should be better, so 
if you missed the class due to phone problems, please join us again!

NEW SUPPORT GROUPS FOR WOMEN WRITERS AND VISIONARY ENTREPRENEURS
Starting in February, 2003: New support groups forming for women 
writers and for visionary entrepreneurs (lightworkers, writers, 
artists, and anyone else who wants to change the world through 
business!). Two hour-long group sessions via phone per month with 
email support - only $50/month, with limit of 10 people in each 
group. Please email coach@herspace.com with which group you'd like 
to be in (writers or entrepreneurs) and preferred days and times 
(with time zone) so I can get an idea of when to schedule the 
groups. 

THAT'S ALL FOR NOW!! DON'T FORGET TO WATCH FARSCAPE! ;-)

Happy 2003!!
Stephanie
