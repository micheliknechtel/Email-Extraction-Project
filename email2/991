THIS WEEK'S CALL TO ACTION: Understanding how the new Congress will affect 
diabetes.

On Tuesday, January 7th, members of the 108th Congress were sworn into 
office. What does this mean for people with diabetes?

The 2002 elections led to a significantly different congressional make-up 
than had previously existed. Most significant was the fact that the Senate 
once again switched majority and minority parties, with the Republican Party 
holding the lead by a 51 - 48 seat margin (there is one Independent 
senator). The Republican Party also widened their margin in the House of 
Representatives. It now holds 229 seats to the Democrats' 205 seats (there 
is one Independent representative). This is the first time since 1993 that 
the same party has controlled the House of Representatives, the Senate and 
the White House.

Although this reflects a dramatic shift on a political level, these changes 
should not affect the role of the American Diabetes Association as it works 
for all people affected by diabetes. The epidemic rise of diabetes over the 
past decade is not a partisan issue - it is a public health issue. Indeed, a 
new study was just released on December 31, 2002 that shows a continuing 
rise in diabetes rates across the country. From 2000 to 2001 - just one year 
- diabetes rates grew eight percent. This means that from 1990 to 2001, 
diabetes rates had risen a frightening 61 percent in our country. You do not 
have to be a Democrat or Republican to understand the public health crisis 
that this represents.

There was one change on the political landscape that may benefit people with 
diabetes. Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) was recently elected Majority Leader of 
the Senate. Because he is a surgeon by training and has shown a significant 
interest in health issues in the past, the Association is hopeful that this 
will elevate all health issues - including diabetes - to one of the highest 
priorities on the Senate's legislative agenda. As you may remember, in the 
last congressional session, Senator Frist introduced the IMPACT legislation, 
designed to address the burgeoning problem of obesity in America. The 
Association was honored to support Senator Frist in the announcement of this 
bill, and hopes to continue working with him in the 108th Congress.

Currently, the Association is working with members of Congress on various 
pieces of legislation that will benefit all people with diabetes. In the 
next few weeks and months, you will be hearing from us about this 
legislation and about ways that you can get involved. For ideas on how to 
contact your elected officials about diabetes, click here:
