STAR WARS HOMING BEACON - The Official StarWars.com Newsletter
Thursday, 01-09-03 - Issue #76

Welcome back to the Homing Beacon, the official newsletter of
starwars.com.

INSIDE THE FACTORY
A late addition to the postproduction of Episode II was the elaborate 
Geonosian droid factory set piece, which was conceived, scripted, 
previsualized and shot months after principal photography had wrapped. 
Visual Effects Supervisor Ben Snow and his unit tackled the eleventh 
hour action sequence. 

"We used a combination of computer graphics and miniature work for the 
environment," says Snow. "Since everything in the factory is moving and 
interacting, we made a lot of it in computer graphics so we can deal 
with the complexity and the interaction." 

The rust-hued smoke-belching clamor of the factory was a perfect 
showcase for the signature "used universe" feel of Star Wars. "To get a 
realistic grime and gritty feel, we enhanced our shots with CG and real 
smoke, sparks and pyrotechnical elements," says Snow. "To make the 
sequence tense and scary, we wanted to push for a realistic feel." 

To that end, Snow took a crew of computer graphic artists and 
model-makers to a real automobile factory in the San Francisco Bay
Area. "We looked at all these machines in action and try to get a good
feel for it," he says. "One of the daunting things is just how much 
complexity there is in this real factory, and trying to reproduce that 
in computer graphics and visual effects is a bit overwhelming. But 
you're trying to convey an impression of it rather than having to get 
every bit of grime in there." 

Even the car factory was judged too austere. "We decided we needed to 
take the team somewhere a bit nastier," says Snow. "We visited a
foundry in the East Bay, and this was paydirt as far as I was
concerned. Dark, and dirty, and old, I think it really defined the
look we were going for. It had the texture and the sulfuric industrial
smell that we wanted to try to evoke in our work. We took a bunch of
photographs that we used as texture reference when painting our CG
models and miniatures. It's really important to have good reference.
It keeps us honest, particularly if we're doing a largely computer
graphic scene." 

The final factory environment was created using a combination of 
computer-generated elements and miniatures, with bluescreen plate 
photography of the actors properly aligned into the virtual 
surroundings. Helping add to the realism of the finished shots was a 
sense of purpose to the enveloping chaos. 

"In a lot of the shots the machines could just be whirling around 
threateningly, but I thought it would make the sequence more exciting
to see that the machines were actually building things," says Snow.
"One of the things I did was to sit down and try to work out what each
conveyer belt was doing, and made little maps showing the manufacturing
process for the animators and artists on the sequence."
