This year prior to the <a href="http://www.euroconference.org/">ESWC</a>
conference, I went on a trip to Budapest with 
<a href="http://www.elfring.com">Gary Elfring</a>, Eric
Isaacson, Jessica Dewell.  We arrived back in Cologne the Wednesday
evening prior to the 2nd Annual European Shareware Conference.  We
checked into the Sonata, five winding blocks from the 
<a href="http://www.euroconference.org/hotel2002.htm">Maritim Hotel</a> 
where the conference
was being held.  That evening, Jessica Dewell and Pete Olson, both
from 
<a href="http://www.digitalriver.com">Digital River</a>, and I went to the Fruh near the cathedral to
sample some local beer. Pete and I were part of a panel on
marketing, so it was nice to meet him ahead of time. The Fruh
blasts an obnoxious Auf Veidersehen song at midnight, letting
everyone know it's time to leave.
<p>
The next day I had the opportunity to do some shopping, stop by and
see my friends at <a href="http://www.shareit.com">Element5/ShareIt</a>, and then pick
up Dmitri Kourashev of <a href="http://www.radmin.com">Famatech</a>, at the train
station.  It was nice to be able to return the favor to Dmitri
since he was one of my Russian hosts in Moscow. :)  That night,
Digital River hosted snacks and beer at the Fruh, allowing us to
hear the Auf Veidersehen song one more time and catch up with all
the familiar faces from last year.
<p>
Friday's panel topics were Your Web Presence, How to Sell Software,
Marketing, Getting to Know Your Customers, and How to Choose an
E-Commerce Partner.  Pete and I spoke at the marketing panel,
offering shareware authors tips on getting their products in front
of customers. Friday night was a dinner hosted by Digital River and
again more Kolsch.
<p>
After the dinner wound down, we went to Bruegal for some live jazz.
 At first our HUGE presence wasn't appreciated by the waitstaff. 
Funny they were quick to accept the 6 Euro per person cover charge,
but there were no available tables and the wait staff acted as if
standing ANYWHERE was in their way! ;)   After the jazz band
started I completely forgot about the wait staff; I LOVE music,
especially live music. I would have photos of Bruegal, however, you
will have to settle for Jessica Dewell's adventures instead,
because she had my camera during her funny trip to McDonalds!
<p>
Saturday's panel topics were Easy Marketing, Case Studies of
Successful Authors, Registration Incentives, Tax Law, Publishing &amp;
Localization, and Software Patents.  I skipped out on the last half
of the afternoon with a small group (led by Bodo of ShareIt! -
thanks Bodo!) to get some 
<a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/images/loripics/ESWC2002/LoriESWCAlbum/PMAlbum/index.htm">breathtaking photos</a> from the top of the
Koln Cathedral - last time I climbed those 500 winding stairs I
didn't have a digital camera, so it was definitely worth it!  After
the last panel, everyone had a short break before leaving on the
Rhine River Cruise sponsored by ShareIt/Element5.  It was fantastic
and I met a few new people… Eugene Malita from <a href="http://www.east-tec.com">East-Tec</a>
(Romania), Marko Hasa from <a href="http://www.labf.com">LabF</a> (Finland), and Markus
Schueler from <a href="http://www.browserbob.com">BrowserBob</a> (Cologne),
<p>
It was funny to meet new shareware contacts on this cruise because
I decided to wear my pink wig (from Halloween), so halfway through
the Rhine River Cruise I thought it would be fun to share the pink
wig... enjoy the 
<a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/images/loripics/ESWC2002/Eric_Pages/page08.htm">multiple photos</a> of EVERYONE wearing the pink wig!
Everyone was a great sport... especially knowing that this will end
up on the Web! :)  Thank you for sharing in the fun everyone!
<p>
Saturday night after the river cruise, people tried to organize the
next location, but it was chaos!  I attempted to follow a group of
25 or so people to a disco, but fell behind at traffic lights and
then lost the group.  A HUGE thanks to Danny Weidig, who I ran into
after I lost everyone else, for helping me find my way back to the
hotel.  I was (unfortunately) asleep by 1:30am - unlike the after
sunrise party enjoyed by many of the other attendees!
<p>
Sunday was a day of packing, wandering on last minute errands, and
saying goodbye :( Although I had some great company and then a
fantastic dinner (thanks David Boventer!) - plus my first ever
Go-Kart race at the Michael-Schumacher Kart Center in Kerpen (the
town I first visited in Germany back in 1988). I wasn't very fast,
or even brave.  I was the slowest and was lapped (twice) by
everyone.  It was just an adventure for me, not a competition!
<p>
Thank you everyone for another great conference... and special
thanks to <a href="http://www.eji.com/">Eric Isaacson</a> for one set of
photos!  I'm looking forward to next year!

 <b>Superior Search v1.0 [2.33mb] W9x/ME/2k/XP $29</b><p>

 <a class="url" href="http://www.superiorsearch.com/">http://www.superiorsearch.com/</a><p>

{Easy Searching} Think of this program as your computers personal
"Google".  This is by far one of my favorite programs I've gotten
to review lately. With Superior Search you can search WITHIN files
and folders for keywords.  Lets say you want to search every file
containing the word "Sam" so you find out what info about you is on
your computer - with this program you can!  You can limit your
searches to certain types of files and even search within password
protected ZIP files.  The search is format and language
independent.  To sum this program up, think of your basic Windows
search function, but now on steroids.  It will even open up the
document and highlight the queried word.  Nothing is safe with this
program, with its ease of use and sleek design it's a definite pick
of mine. [Sam]
<p><br> 
 <b>PowerGrep v1.1.0 [1.4mb] W9x/ME/2k/XP $99</b><p>

 <a class="url" href="http://www.powergrep.com/">http://www.powergrep.com/</a><p>

{Search and Replace}  This program will search for keywords within
text and binary files to find exactly what you want.  It can also
perform the wonderful "search and replace" feature for easy
maintenance for files containing such things as source code for a
site if you were to change a folder name or path.  With the Collect
feature, you can gather statistics and extract data from files
easily.  The Sequencing feature allows you to search and replace on
every file automatically, with no user intervention required. 
Results of each step are listed and recorded for archives.  You can
even preview and undo what you have changed if you've made a
mistake in your search.  The program runs smooth and with its small
file size it packs a big punch in such a small program.  PowerGREP
is meant for the hardcore search and replace person and for someone
that wants to find certain words within a file with options to edit
it. [Sam]
<p><br>
 <b>PrintFolder Pro v3.0 [537kb] W9x/ME/2k/XP $25</b><p>

 <a class="url" href="http://no-nonsense-soft">http://no-nonsense-software.com/printfolder/</a><p>

{File Printing} Ever wanted to print a list of the contents of a
folder?  This is a common question that is asked on Chris's show,
"Call For Help".  There was never really a great answer to this
question, since not many people had made a program worth while,
until now.  With PrintFolder Pro you can print a list of the
contents of a folder which includes the following: Name, Date,
Time, Size and Attributes.  A great use for this program would be
for the audiophile in your life.  You could burn a CD, then print a
list of the songs right from the folder you burned it from, so you
can find your song easily and efficiently.  It even has MP3 support
(include any fields from the ID3 tag).  You can even save it as an
HTML or delimited file to post online, or to do whatever you want
with.  For this program being only about half-a-meg it does the the
job and does it well. [Sam]

 <b>SuperCat v4.3 [1.2mb] W9x/ME/2k/XP $29</b><p>

 <a class="url" href="http://no-nonsense-software.com/supercat/">http://no-nonsense-software.com/supercat/</a><p>

{Cataloging} SuperCat lets you catalog all your disks. Finding
files on hard drives, removable disks such as CD-ROMs, Zip disks,
and diskettes can become close to impossible at times.  SuperCat
has a powerful export feature, search inside compressed archives,
image viewer, built in unzip utility, as well as schedule catalogs
for unattended and automatic updates.  With this program you can
archive your entire computer and all of your removable media for
future use so nothing will ever get lost.  I think this program
would be greatly appreciated by the power-users and network
administrators that want to keep tabs on their property. [Sam]
<p><br>
 <b>Repligator v9 [1.5mb] W9x/2k/XP $34.95</b><p>

 <a class="url" href="http://www.ransen.com/Repligator/default.htm">http://www.ransen.com/Repligator/default.htm</a><p>

{Imaged Effects} Adding effects to images can be a pain sometimes,
and spending the money for a program such as PhotoShop or Paint
Shop Pro when all you want to do is add a cool effect to an image
doesn't make sense.  With Repligator you can choose from over 70
colorful designs.  Simply open an image file or bring an image in
from the clipboard and let Repligator do the rest. Just by pushing
F7 or F12 Repligator will get to work and produce special effects
on your images.  If you want to add a special little "oomph" to an
image this program will definitely accomplish the mission [Sam]
<p><br>
 <b>Turbo Demo v2 [5.07mb] w98/2k/XP $890</b><p>
 
 <a class="url" href="http://www.turbodemo.com/">http://www.turbodemo.com/</a><p>

{Demo Creator} A program that makes it easy for experts and
beginners alike to create their own presentations and
demonstrations on how to use software, in an automated setup.  This
thing really is self explanatory, I was creating miniature shows in
just minutes.  If you read the first few tips that come up on
start-up and the short instructions upon clicking the new button in
file, you will not have any problems either. It simply sets up a
red box on clicking start, you take screen shots as often as you
like, press print screen and it sets up a nice little chain of
animation. You then animate the mouse and change the icon however
you like, to make it appear as though you are actually clicking in
the demo. You can insert balloons, insert and play sounds, and
choose/define options. The best part of all, it's like a
self-zipping file, the average 1 minute file exports at a scary
.1MB file when you are done. This thing compiles itself for
webpages and everything. (*Footnote no kitchen sink) In two
words... it's sexy. [Sam]
<p><br>

 <b>Go1984 v2 [3.89mb] w98/ME/2k/XP $39.95</b><p>
 
 <a class="url" href="http://go1984.de/en/">http://go1984.de/en/</a><p>

{Surveillance} This software helps users wanting protection or
information.  It is a surveillance program designed for any camera
that can plug into your computer.  Go1984 allows you to set times
of surveillance (if you want to save space), what type of imagery
you are getting, streaming or clip, and what type of detection you
want, streaming, motion censored, or grouped (for more than one
person on the network).  You can have as many hookups and data
lines as the computer allows. There is more than one alarm option,
and you can video conference with it. Go1984 requires minimal
system requirements for today's market, and if you need discreet
protection, it is great. [Sam]
<p><br>
 <b>Digest Source v1.1.3 [5.33mb] W9x/ME/2k/XP $29</b><p>

 <a class="url" href="http://www.digestsoftware.com/">http://www.digestsoftware.com/</a><p>

{Keywords} I really do wish I had this program about two weeks ago
as I was doing research.  This program takes entire webpages or
text files, looks for keywords (words most commonly used), and
takes out highlights with the most of the keywords in them. It
displays it in a neat easy-readable format, on its own page. You
can specify any keyword you want, or you can let it do its job by
itself. You can also denote words to skip/ignore (it already has a
list of common ones like a, at, etc...). Digest Source comes in two
languages, German and English. I have yet to see a summary program
this comprehensive. [Sam]
