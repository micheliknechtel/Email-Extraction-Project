This New Year get the best support you’ll ever have so that the resolution
to lose weight won't be on your list next year. Make sure of your place on
our DietCoaching groups by telephone.
See what participants are saying:

“The weekly telephone calls have increased my commitment to the programme.
They were conducted just like face-to-face groups and you got to know people
’s voices even though you couldn’t see them. And nobody ever had to say what
they weighed at any point.” JF

“I found myself actually caring about the group even though you couldn’t see
them. And you have a chance for one-to-one coaching too. I’ve had my own
eating quirks ironed out and since we’re all in the same boat, other people’
s issues ring true for me as well. I have found relief knowing that I’m not
alone and yet you haven’t got the competitiveness that you have in the
traditional face-to-face diet clubs.” Joan

Only $40 per month (24 GBP) for as many classes per week as you choose. Book
on www.thedietcoach.com Click on the right hand box ‘Join Judy Citron’s
telephone support groups’ and on to our secure server. If after your first
group you decide that you can’t benefit, then we will give you a full
refund.

Decisions decisions
In your day to day life you are constantly making choices. First of all you
choose what to wear, then you choose where to go (at least at weekends). You
choose what to do. And of course your choose what to buy.

Say you want a new CD player. You may have a look at a consumer magazine,
you may surf the internet, you may take advice from a shop assistant or you
may ask a friend who knows about these things. But at the end of the day you
will only buy one CD player carefully chosen from among the large range on
offer.

Now I'm going to offer you the theory that for slim people, choosing food is
not very different to choosing a CD player. It sounds preposterous but just
read on and you¹ll see that it¹s true. First let me start with how I would
have behaved in my overweight days. Imagine me (or you) at a party and
there's a beautiful buffet table of deserts laid out. In the past it would
have been too much for me ­ I would have chosen two or three or four deserts
muttering to anyone within earshot that I just can't resist. Then of course
I would have gone back for more taking a clean plate in the hope that anyone
watching me would think it was my first time round. Of course I would have
done  this all the while saying to myself that tomorrow I'll go back on
diet. The self deception and subterfuge that one practises is frightening.

Now let's have a look at the behaviour of the naturally slim person at the
buffet desert table. The slim person hovers, listens to the conversation
around, listens to their taste buds all the while and makes a choice. You
can bet that they'll choose either one desert or a small portion of two. No
apologies. Maybe just a whisper of 'naughty but nice'. And  you can be
pretty sure that they won't go back for more. They'll be satisfied (not
stuffed) and after all, tomorrow they can have a different desert somewhere
else. Yes ­ they chose from among the tasty food. Just the same as they
would only choose one CD player.

Choosing food is a characteristic of a gourmet eater. Some of us with a
weight problem have lost the art of being gourmets. We'll eat anything. How
many of you can own up to eating stale bread or stale cake? Or even worse,
frozen bread or frozen cake?

If only we can train ourselves to make gourmet choices then we would solve a
lot of problems. If we can learn to eat food which is really really worth
having and reject the run of the mill, we will make weight loss a very
normal process. We must practice very very slow eating and through slow
eating you will come to savour food and appreciate every bite. The dieter
has come to view food as always rationed.  There's always more tomorrow if
you can rid yourself of the deprivation diet mentality.

Here¹s to the future gourmet you.
