Microsoft Unveils Smart Watches, Media Players (1/10/2003)
http://pocketpcwire.com/nl?4507
[article] Call me a Microsoft fanboy if you want, but why does it take a
company like Microsoft to do something like this - something so simple,
so obvious. I know that Microsoft isn't the first to make "smart
watches", but there's a clarity of vision here that makes more sense
than anything else I've seen from other companies on the market."The
smart watches, which recall the futuristic designs once popularized by
the comic book crime fighter Dick Tracy, will receive data over FM radio
spectrum leased by Microsoft, a system the company calls DirectBand.
Watch makers such as Fossil and Citizen have signed on to produce the
devices, which run on chips manufactured by National Semiconductor and
utilize Microsoft's Smart Personal Objects Technology, or SPOT. No
determination had been made yet as to what, if any, monthly service fees
would be charged or whether Microsoft or the watch makers would control
how users customize their wrist-borne devices, company representatives
said."Then there's the portable media player design. This sounds like a
very cool idea, but I wish Microsoft would build the hardware - they
make good, solid hardware. But, like the Pocket PC, they don't want to
go it alone - they want to build up an industry around them, and that
means getting OEMs on board."Microsoft also said it is working with
Intel Corp. on a design for portable players code-named "Media2Go." The
devices, which would hold at least 12 hours of audio or six hours of
video, are targeted to hit retailers later this year. Among the
companies that will build the units, Microsoft said, are Sanyo, Samsung
and ViewSonic. The new players will feature screens at least four inches
wide, with ports to connect them to television sets for video-quality
playback."There's a very interesting video that talks about SPOT on CNET
that you should check out (thanks to Peter West for sending it in).

How to Learn the 10 Technologies that Will Help You Stay Emp (1/10/2003)
http://pocketpcwire.com/nl?4508
[article] One of my favorite developer sites is DevX.com. A recent
editorial by A. Russel Jones caught my interest and I'd like to share it
with you! The article touches on the eternal subject of learning. By
first having brought up 10 key technologies to stay on top of, Russel
addresses how to learn them. The 10 technologies identified by Russel
are:#1: XML#2: Web Services #3: Object-Oriented Programming#4: Java,
C++, C#, and VB.NET#5: JavaScript#6: Regular Expressions#7: Design
Patterns#8: Flash MX#9: Linux/Windows#10: SQLYes, I agree. We would like
to see some sort of "mobile" reference to this list but as we move
forward I am convinced "mobile" will become an integral part of all key
technologies and vice versa. Russel writes: "When we told our readers
what technologies they needed to learn, they told us: easier said than
done. While that's true, there is an approach to learning that can make
it easier. With the right attitude and some essential resources, you'll
be on your way slowly but surely."As professionals in the fast IT
industry we have to constantly rethink, relearn and redo. How do you do
it?
