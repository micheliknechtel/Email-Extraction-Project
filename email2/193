PC World's Best Buy for January 7th, 2003               
             
* HP Photosmart 850  

This bulky, but still easily carried, 4-megapixel camera takes good 
pictures and has an attractive price. 

The Photosmart 850 has a great menu system: Press a large button on 
the back of the camera, then select from easy-to-understand text and 
icons. The large LCD screen is sharp and bright. 

The camera features an 8X optical zoom lens, but it uses an electronic 
viewfinder instead of an optical passthrough. The flash is controlled 
manually, so you can prevent it from going off if necessary. You can 
print or e-mail images quickly by pressing a button on the back of the 
camera.
