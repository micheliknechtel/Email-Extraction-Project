Thank You For the Favor

Last time I wanted to see how it would affect my download ranking at 
Amazon if readers downloaded some of my songs by clicking on the link: 
http://snipurl.com/eiu. 

Your response was tremendous. The ranking on many of the songs improved 
by 50 percent through most of the holidays. “Minstrel’s Song” had so 
many downloads that it was temporarily offline. You were a great help.

I won’t ask you to continue trying to boost the ranks. Thank you to each 
of you who tried it out. It was fun to watch.

Choose Love
Copyright (c) 2003 by Benjamin Devey. All rights reserved.

Every day we make choices that affect the quality of our life, our love 
and our relationships. We make many of these decisions without ever 
giving them a lot of thought. Choosing love is easily enough said, 
right? Is the decision to love more difficult than the alternative? Is 
an uncaring life any easier? Please take a moment to consider the 
life-difference of two different approaches. Which one feels right for 
you?

Option 1: Who’s My Neighbor?

Joe Somebody is basically a good person. He reads the scriptures and 
pays tithes to the church where he attends regularly. He loves his 
neighbor as long as his neighbor is nice to him. Come to think of it, he 
has one nice neighbor, another one he don’t know, one who lets a dog run 
free, and another neighbor who he tries to avoid because she’s an 
incurable gossip. Well, to be honest, she’s the broadcast central hub of 
the community and she’s never had anything nice to say about anyone.

Joe is just protecting himself. No one wants to become the subject of 
talk around the neighborhood. It isn’t anyone’s business how you treat 
your children or how often you bring home flowers to your wife. So why 
should Joe include in his circle of friends the person who spreads ill 
words like the Black Plague?

Joe isn’t evil. There’s nothing in the scriptures saying one has to 
enjoy dogs. Never having chosen to be a mongrel manager, Joe hates to 
walk around his own yard with a pooper scooper to clean up after someone 
else’s reprehensible beast. But that goes for other critters too. Why do 
people let their cats run free, digging up everyone’s flower beds to 
spread their cheer in every yard?

Joe carries on an inner monologue: “Can’t people just leave me alone? If 
it isn’t a solicitor on the phone or at the door, it’s probably someone 
worse: someone who wants your help or to save your soul. Can’t they go 
to Kenya and do something about world hunger or population control? 
You’re already saved. Besides that’s why our churches have doors, so we 
can selectively shut out anyone we deem undesirable. 

“And speaking of teeming refuse on the shores, hasn’t anyone ever heard 
of border control? Why should we open our arms to the welfare cases who 
want to suck our system dry, while they import gang crime to our loving 
neighborhoods? Don’t we have deportation laws for anyone with a fake 
Social Security number?”

Joe could go on and on…but we already get the idea.


Option 2: Choose Christ-like Love

Let me start out by saying love doesn’t make the problems of the world 
go away. It isn’t a cure for every difficulty. And it isn’t “all you 
need.”  You can’t do without other indispensable traits like tolerance, 
respect, a healthy sense of humor and a very thick skin. And we couldn’t 
survive without a few other essentials like air, food, water and rest. 
Love may not be everything, but if you were going to choose one platform 
as a sturdy foundation on which to stage the other aspects of life, it’s 
a darn good place to start. 

Recently I listened to a cheerful-looking priest. His countenance was 
radiant. I wondered if he could be so happy, or was it an act? After I 
listened to what he said, I was convinced he was genuine. He spoke with 
carefully-chosen words of respect. He used the term “holy envy” to 
describe the awe he felt for aspects of another religion’s worship. He 
had no place for jealousy or contention in his heart -- only an openness 
of spirit that let in light.

How real is your love?

A friend called the other day to catch up since Christmas. Among other 
things he thanked me for once correcting him. I’d once pointed out that 
I like to always spell out Christmas, because Xmas is like crossing 
Christ out of Christmas. He appreciated the perspective and adopted it 
as his own. 

By itself, that would make a nice story, but another associate 
mistakenly used the dreaded word “Xmas” in a newsletter he distributed. 
Can you imagine the email diatribes he got from a lot of “Christians?” 
He was astonished that the most hateful mail he’d ever received was from 
those most vehemently concerned for the welfare of his soul. I’m sure 
the irony escapes those who use their religion like a weapon to bludgeon 
anyone who makes a mistake at which they take offense. I also hope that 
fanatics who make “an offender for a word” are an outspoken minority, 
apart from the many who quietly practice Christ-like love for others.

I’m convinced that we can’t love and hate at the same time. In other 
words, we can’t be hateful toward anyone and believe that we’re truly 
capable of love. I think James may have been frustrated to see hypocrisy 
among the saints when he said, “Out of the same mouth come praise and 
cursing. My brothers, this should not be.”

There is little difference between someone who kills for Allah and one 
who hates for Jesus. A set of Christian values must mean more than 
acceptance of Christ’s atonement, coupled with a blatant disregard for 
personal accountability for our behavior. Conversion is complete after 
we let the Spirit work to change our hearts. As we experience the grace 
of Christ, we put off the natural man

Jesus said, "Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy 
neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, 
bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for 
them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the 
children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to 
rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on 
the unjust. For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? Do 
not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, 
what do ye more than others? Do not even the publicans so? Be ye 
therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." 
(Matt 5:43-48) 

Love doesn’t look for enemies, unless it’s to find breaches that need to 
be healed. Rather than look for battles, love looks inward to see if he 
or she may have caused any hurt to someone else. Rather than let love 
wax cold, a person who loves finds common goals to agree with an 
adversary. Love is a shared society, not an exclusive club. If we love 
our enemies, we’ll soon run out of enemies.

A person is no better than the way he treats others. One who is callous, 
uncaring or partial toward people will eventually treat his “loved” ones 
with the same abuse. On a personal scale Christianity challenges us to 
be patient, kind and non-judgmental, showing mercy, rather than rage, 
when our expectations aren’t met. We correct with love, helping others 
realize their full potential. 

As much as we can do to show sincere love, there’s also a valid concern 
that we don’t allow ourselves to become victims. Finding a spouse ought 
to be an exercise in discernment. Overlooking red flags like temper, 
unrighteous dominion or disrespect can only lead to tragic 
circumstances. Not only do we need to have sincere love in our heart, we 
need to distinguish between romantic attachment and mutual, caring love 
to assure a bright future.

The Choice to Love

It seems clear that feelings of selfishness, prejudice and contention 
lead to a life of estrangement and loneliness. One who is empty inside 
needs to fill his reservoir before he can love. He needs to learn to 
value others for their uniqueness, rather than how they match up to his 
expectations. The empty person has a choice. He can choose to love. He 
can begin by appreciating the wonderful diversity of others and showing 
gratitude for all the ways we enrich each others’ lives. 

We can all choose to love. I promise, it’s a way to enjoy all that life 
has to offer. In giving love we find it in abundance. Whether you’re 
lonely, single or married, love is a lifestyle that brings blessings. As 
we value others they become a part of our lives and well-being. 


Bless those you love,
Benjamin
