Christmas is over. Which means you can no longer spend all day scoffing chocolates and nodding off in between watching television. So it's a time of spiritual rebirth, healing and self-improvement. And failing that you can always head for the sales.

===Back to school? === 
Now's the time to learn a new language or skill... and BBCi Learning can help. There's educational help for everybody from toddlers to those unfortunate teenagers who have to endure exams this summer.

===Reboot your body===
Is your body waving a little white flag after the season of goodwill? Then do something about it! You can do exercises from your desk or rediscover healthy eating. Or you can do something to make your relationships more healthy...

===Brain food===
Your brain needs a work out too, and BBC Four is like a gym for your grey matter. Tackle the crossword or have a go at the new anagram game. There's also a Doris Lessing profile and a Scorsese interview.

===Happy [tax] returns?===
Is there a more unpleasant word than tax? The problem is that if you avoid it you may have to go to prison. Fortunately BBCi Business and Money can help you with your personal finance matters in time for the new tax year.

===Rubbish!===
It's never too early to start spring cleaning. So get rid of the stuff you don't want, and get ideas on how you actually want your house to look in 2003.

Finally, we can help you get through the cold weather. BBCi Weather and BBCi Travel can help you decide if your journey is worth it. BBCi Gardening lets you know what you should be doing in the cold snap to make sure your garden looks great and that the birds have enough food. And please look out for the elderly and vulnerable people in your community when freezing weather sets in: cold weather can kill.
