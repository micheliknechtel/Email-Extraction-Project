End of the road for No Bull 5 
By RICK MINTER
Cox News Service

Atlanta -- The Winston No Bull 5 program, which offered 
Winston Cup drivers and fans a chance to win a million dollars 
each at selected races, is no more.

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company announced Monday that it is 
discontinuing the program, which began in 1998.

"The Winston No Bull 5 program was a very successful program 
for the Winston brand," said Ned Leary, president of Sports 
Marketing Enterprises, which oversees RJR's racing projects.
"However, we are constantly evaluating the allocation of 
resources. For 2003, the decision has been made to deploy 
those resources in other areas."

Five Winston Cup races each year offered the No Bull 5 bonus. 
The top five finishers in the previous No Bull 5 race were 
eligible for a $1 million bonus if they won the race. Each of 
the five participants was paired with a fan chosen in a random 
drawing. If the fan's driver won the race, the fan also 
collected $1 million. There were at least two winners each 
season.

The decision to drop the bonus program does not affect RJR's 
sponsorship of NASCAR's elite division, the Winston Cup Series.

Rick Minter writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Alterations have teams starting from zero
By Denise N. Maloof, CNNSI.com January 8, 2003
2:35 PM EST (1935 GMT) 

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Baseball has spring training. 

Professional football, basketball and hockey have training 
camp. 

And now, NASCAR has "Preseason Thunder." It's the new moniker 
assigned to an old tradition -- test sessions at Daytona -- and 
as the 2003 season roars to life, change is in the air. 

Several major alterations have the entire Winston Cup field 
starting from zero. In a bid to eliminate "aerodynamic push" or
the inability to pass, NASCAR officials have mandated several 
changes designed to bring all four manufacturers more in line 
with one another. 

Starting this season, all Cup cars will be measured from the 
same body line -- 60 inches, with a leeway of a half-inch, 
from the vertical center of the rear axel to the front edge 
of the roof (or where the windshield begins). Everyone also 
must run the same size spoiler -- 55 inches wide and six and 
1/4 inches tall.

And there's now a minimum weight on the rear axel. 

"Its minimum required weight is 3,400 pounds," said John Darby, 
Winston Cup series director. "So when we weigh the two rear 
wheels together, the weight can not exceed 1,700 pounds." 

NASCAR officials hope the move toward standardization will 
help them make more uniform rules adjustments -- no different 
increments for a Ford, a Pontiac, etc. -- plus, eliminate the 
manufacturer and team squawking that's part of life in the 
Winston Cup garage. 

"It's actually been extremely quiet," said Darby of Tuesday's 
first sessions, which were staffed by 21 NASCAR officials. Most 
cars went through a full morning inspection, mostly for the 
teams' benefit (NASCAR's only test requirement at Daytona is 
that teams run the appropriate restrictor plate). And although 
it's too early to tell the new rules' effects, teams know 
things will be different.

"The drafting is going to be a little bit tougher; the cars 
are going to be more equal than they've ever been before 
because of the way the templates are," said James Ince, Johnny 
Benson's crew chief. "So based on that, it's going to put a 
lot more emphasis on your engine program and your race car
driver and your pit stops -- make sure you call a good race." 

Darby said roughly 50 percent of NASCAR's 2003 templates were 
"matches." He used the example of the "F3" template, which 
will be the uniform measure of all car rooflines this season. 

Some guys think individuality is over-rated. 

"I think that's all a bunch of malarkey," said Mike Skinner, 
whose Pontiac was the day's fastest car. "I think these cars 
are ought to have the same spoiler, the same everything, and 
make these guys work on the car."
