Fix It Fast
By Janet Roberts
_________________

I made a mistake in the previous Ezine-Tip, which will be corrected
below, but, oddly enough, I don't feel as bad about it as I should.

Oh, I'm angry at myself for violating a cardinal rule of sending
email newsletters, to test each and every link before I hit "send."

That's why I didn't see that a punctuation mark messed up the URL 
for the Lyris ContentChecker for our text-version readers. Some of
those who tried it out ended up with a 404 form instead.

Also, I'm embarrassed about inconveniencing those readers. So, 
here's the right one. I tested it, I promise:  
http://www.lyris.com/contentchecker/ . 

Now, why don't I feel as bad about this as I should? Because I was
in good company that day. Four newsletter corrections came through on 
one day, all to fix mistakes that would have created problems for 
readers. Then, I found URL problems in two others that have not
been corrected yet.

So, at least I was not the only publisher who messed up. That 
doesn't make readers feel better about having a bad experience, of
course. It also made me think about the right and wrong ways to 
correct a mistake.

One of the other cardinal rules of email publishing is always to
correct functional mistakes as well as factual ones as quickly as
possible. 

Here are a few suggestions for those rare occasions when you mess up:

1. Correct fact errors in the next issue. Functional mistakes might 
   have to be corrected in a special edition.

   If you mess up a URL, supply an incorrect email address or do
   something else that prevents a reader from getting the full use
   of your information, and if your next issue is more than a day 
   away, send a special edition. 

2. Explain briefly why you're sending out a correction and apologize
   for inconveniencing readers. How much you say depends on how 
   grievous the error was. Skip it if you have to go into a 
   convoluted explanation, but if someone gave you bad information, 
   point that out without pointing fingers. "Because incorrect 
   information was supplied to us ... ," for example.

3. Test it, test it, test it.

4. Treat each correction incident as a reminder that something
   slipped up in the publication process. If you find that the
   correction section is becoming a regular feature of your 
   newsletter, or you're sending a correction issue almost as often 
   as a regular one, it's time to find the problem.
