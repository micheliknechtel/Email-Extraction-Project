I promised to publish links to some of the predictions for 2003
today. Some of them don't exist as web pages, so I've asked the
authors to provide them and let me know the URLs. I hope to have
them for Friday's issue.

==> TOPIC: INTERRUPTION OR PERMISSION?

From: Mike Berst <pearlstreet@torchlake.com>

William Ernest Waites' comments about spam raise a couple of good
points, but I have a different take on his conclusions.

Spammers can make money whether or not the spam itself generates any
sales. All they have to do is convince their client that the spam
will work, and sell them a program of broadcasting UCE.

There are probably enough businesses willing to hire a spammer that
the spammer doesn't have to worry about customer satisfaction, he
can just head down the road to the next victim.

Also I think it is a stretch to say that the money that businesses
pay to spammers is part of the Internet economy. In the same way it
could be argued that a bank robber is part of the economy since he
will eventually spend his ill-gotten gains with a legitimate
business.

William Waites wrote:
>> While I am no fan of SPAM, this observation only looks at one
side of the issue. SPAM messages do connect with some interested
parties. Otherwise, why are all the SPAMMERS doing it? <<

The large spammers are doing it on behalf of small, naive companies
who know no better. Spammers are making a mint promising "confirmed
opt-in" messages be sent, while aggregating their collections from
postings to online forums.

>> Not just because it's free. <<

Indeed, exactly because it is free, or unrealistically low-cost
(robbers have overhead, too -- the get-away car needs gas, for
instance.) Spammers send millions upon millions, with a
click-through rate that would get any honest marketer fired in a New
York minute.

The resource of names is stolen, the resource of the sending
computer is stolen (open relays and proxies in third-world countries
is the predominant manner in which this stuff is sent from the U.S.,
reflected off a computer in Asia, back to North America.

>>It also is untrue that SPAM doesn't pay for the internet. While
the SPAM message may not pay for passage, somewhere there are
servers and designers and writers who are making money from the
advertising messages some call SPAM. They are part of the Internet
just as much as bandwidth is. <<

Then who precisely is paying for the bandwidth they are eating up?
One freemail service noted that 90% of the 1.5 BILLION emails they
deal with DAILY is spam. How does the spammer have any positive
effect on the amount of bandwidth needed to deal with that problem?

Here's another example of a small-time domain owner who has to
contend with a massive influx of spam, robbing him of his bandwidth:
http://striker.ottawa.on.ca/

550,000 attempts to spam, daily. Who is paying for that? The domain
owner, of course!

>> Sorry. I find SPAM irritating too, just as I find some TV
commercials, radio commercials, direct mail packages, newspaper and
magazine ads and outdoor boards offensive if they don't serve my
immediate need when I see them. Everyone of those also places some
burden on society. In the end, however, they do more to add value
than to subtract it. <<

Hey, I like naked teens as much as most people, but I don't consider
spam as being a value-addition to my email box, nor society in
general (with apologies to naked teens everywhere). Commercials on
TV, radio, newspapers, etc. help to pay for the content and
infrastructure which is offered to the consumer, free of charge, or
for a fee lower than the cost of production and distribution, and
room for profit, of course.

Last time I looked, I am paying for my bandwidth, and willingly
(grudgingly) accept advertisements in the content I get for free or
a nominal fee on the Internet. Fair trade, and all.

Spammers circumvent that, make no contribution to content, and rob
us all blind.

Or do you really think that AOL, et al, do NOT pass the costs of the
increased bandwidth and servers they must buy to keep ahead of the
spam influx, on to the end user? Surely not.

[ Moderator comment ]

We can probably agree, as a generalisation, that spammers are kept
afloat by naive newcomers to the Internet, by the greedy brain-dead
and by inept corporate marketing people who insist on advertising
the fact that they haven't a clue when it comes to doing their jobs.

I'm not sure where this discussion can go from here, really. Let's
wrap it up now, unless you have a blinding insight that can make a
difference.

The report was erroneous. US publishers, like all others, just need
to worry about being right. <<

While your comment may be consistent in its truth content, it is
narrowly focused on the issue of libel. Let's look at two other
scenarios:

A U.S. Web site says something insulting about a German politician
(or rock star), and

A U.S. Web site claims that the Holocaust is a hoax.

Both of these actions (insult and Holocaust revisionism) are legal
in the U.S., but illegal in Germany. So if I call Helmut Kohl an
@$$#*|* on my private U.S. Web site, should I be charged with a
crime in Germany?

Perhaps CNN, ABC, and CBS should face criminal charges in Iraq for
Web site postings that are obviously crimes in that country! Those
of us who post images of women's faces on Web sites should perhaps
face charges in Saudi Arabia.

My point is that libel is just one issue. This is even more
complicated than the fact that libel is differently defined, and the
burden of proof is different, in various jurisdictions. There are
many, many different kinds of speech acts that are legal in one
location, but prosecutable in another. When we accept the fact that
a Web site posting in one country is subject to libel laws of other
countries, we open the door to saying that other crimes can be
similarly prosecuted -- even if they are not crimes in the country
where they were posted.

==> TOPIC: TRAFFIC BOOSTERS

From: Jeff Smith <jbsmith@igs.net>

In Ramon's listing, a product called Mailoop was included. I have
had some experience with this product, though I would not call it a
traffic booster so much as it is a traffic manager.

Mailoop is one of a few software products that attempts to put a
simple database and usable front end onto various marketing
functions including: all incoming and outgoing mail, personal
autoresponder for automated follow-up email, scheduled broadcast
messages to all or a sub-section of mail lists, and various other
email list management functions such as subscribe and unsubscribe
automation.

The pitch on profits is more to do with online marketers having
these campaigns such as follow-up email marketing, newsletters,
affiliate programs, etc. Mailoop is just one of a few tools that can
help manage such campaigns.

A final point -- any half-decent software product should offer you a
demo version that lets you test the software before buying. IMC
offers a demo of Mailoop, it's really important that users check
this out first -- it's a pretty heavy system that I found to be a
little difficult transferring information between other systems. So
make sure you like it before you buy it.

Hope this helps...

==> TOPIC: TRAFFIC BOOSTERS

From: Cayley Vos <cvos@netpaths.net>

There's a major difference between "traffic boosters" and "marketing
tools". Save your cash and don't buy traffic boosters, automated
search engine submissions, and anything that offers to submit your
site to search engines. There is NO WAY you can improve a search
engine listing without careful efforts by hand.

Marketing tools, such as email programs can be effective for
promoting your business, providing you use them properly and
ethically. In my experience, the only way to use email marketing is
from using a list hand collected by your company. If you try to buy
lists, you will get complaints, as you will be sending unsolicited
information to unsuspecting individuals.

With any product, ask if you can talk directly with past customers.
Personally I believe that anyone with 10 pages of marketing hype is
selling just that: long winded hype. If you cant sell your product
in 1 paragraph, you don¹t have a product.

Finally, I have found that the quality of the seller's website can
be an indication of the quality of their product, but this is
definitely not a rule. I have gotten some of my best information
from the most unprofessional looking websites.

==> TOPIC: TRAFFIC BOOSTERS

From: John Vorwerk <john@4officeautomation.com>

Hello John and Ramon and fellow I-Salers,

First of all, a happy new 2003 to everyone!

Ramon, as you have mentioned Mailloop, this of course caught my eye
as a vendor of a similar (many people say superior) product named
EmailUnlimited.

I also use a rather long copy -- not as long as Corey's, but still a
number of pages. The reason: it works. I have once experimented with
a shorter, more technical copy, however, had to face a mighty
decrease in sales and trial download, and immediately switched back
to long copy again.

So what is the benefit of using a program like Mailloop or
EmailUnlimited?

Next to sending email announcements and newsletter to your list, the
best part probably is the follow-up auto responder. It allows you to
automatically build a relationship to customers.

You can send personalized emails as if you were drafting them
manually. You can send download links in case their first down- load
attempt was interrupted, remind them to read your ebook, offer
support and ask for feedback (I send automatic HTML surveys).

Customers feel comfortable (ok, some say I am getting on their
nerves ;) ) and I can focus on creating better products. In fact, my
success as an entrepreneur is based on using autoresponder to
enhance relationships to customers. And claims that this kind of
tool can raise revenues by large percentages may sometimes be
exaggerated, however, a year ago, when I bought a new computer, my
follow-up system only pretended to work, with the same results as
switching to short copy: sales plunged deeply.

So to go directly to your questions:

a) So what's out there? I'd say more than a hundred products, most
of them trash.

b) Follow-up autoresponders to enhance relationships to your
customers.

c) Watch for good support and trial versions. Don't buy a program
you can't test.

d) Gammadyne is reputable, Postmaster is reputable, MailWorkz is
reputable (although it cannot even send autoresponses), I guess
Mailloop is reputable, as Ramon mentions it, and Ralph Wilson's
readers say that I am reputable as well.

All the best,
