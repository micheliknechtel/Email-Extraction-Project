This week's top stories:

LITTLE SUCCESS IN SAVING MAJOR ART

LONDON. On the eve of its 50th anniversary, the UK’s Export Reviewing Committee has issued a stark warning. The committee was set up to protect Britain’s heritage by offering museums and galleries the chance to buy major artworks which would otherwise be exported. “Through a lack of funding, the system has failed totally to achieve this objective,” the reviewing committee admits in its annual report.

WE SERVE ALL CULTURES, SAY THE BIG, GLOBAL MUSEUMS

LONDON. The world’s leading museums have for the first time united to issue a declaration. Their statement on “the importance and value of universal museums” follows increasing concern about the politicisation of Greek claims against the British Museum (BM) over the Parthenon Marbles.

FIRST MUSEUM PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP
TURIN.  Italy under Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has shown itself as ready to privatise its cultural institutions as its State-run businesses. This had its first practical application for a State museum with the publication of the new constitution of Turin’s Egyptian Museum in December. It will be closely watched as the first example of collaboration between the private and public sector in the administration of the Italian State patrimony. Supporters of this move believe that it will lead to the more efficient administration and better use of cultural institutions. Opponents are afraid that the emphasis will now be put on  exploiting them financially and that scholarly values will be  sacrificed.

EXPORT REVIEWING COMMITTEE DECLARES CROSS A FAKE

LONDON. An Anglo-Saxon cross which was one of the stars of the Grosvenor House fair has now been dismissed as a modern fake. Bond Street gallery Rupert Wace sold the carved cross shaft to an American dealer for over $500,000 (£314,690), and he in turn is currently selling it on to a US museum. The cross therefore required a UK export licence, and it was then that specialists questioned its authenticity. In what has turned out to be an extraordinary case, the Export Reviewing Committee concluded early in December that it dated from the early 20th century.

MANTEGNA AND FRIENDS: OLD MASTERS IN THE JANUARY SALES
NEW YORK. All the Old Master buzz in New York this month  is centered on Andrea Mantegna’s The Descent into Limbo which Basia Johnson, the Johnson baby products heiress, has consigned to Sotheby’s for sale on 23 January with an estimate of $20-30 million.   Despite the fact that it is one of the last great Renaissance masterpieces remaining outside a museum, and though its strong estimate is justifiable, there are surprisingly few collectors or museums who could conceivably bid.
