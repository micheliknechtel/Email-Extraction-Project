THIS WEEK IN HEALTH NEWS
========================

This Week In Health - January 10, 2003
----------------------------------------------------------------
Our weekly roundup of the latest developments in the world of
health.

More insight into the heart benefits of moderate drinking, flu
fatalities and obesity's effect on life expectancy were in the
news this week.  We also look at why some people might be
destined for high blood pressure from birth. Stay well.

This Issue:

A Drink A Day
The Flu's A Killer
Obesity Shortens Life
Blood Pressure Risk At Birth

In The News:

A Drink A Day

 Just a little bit of alcohol every day may keep heart attacks
away.  Earlier studies have shown that moderate alcohol
consumption can lower a person's risk of heart disease, The
Associated Press reports.  But a new study published in the New
England Journal of Medicine finds that the heart-healthy benefits
of alcohol may depend on how often you drink it.  Researchers
from Harvard Medical School analyzed data on 38,077 male health
professionals participating in a long-term health study.  The
researchers found that men who consumed as little as half a drink
every day had a lower risk of heart attacks than men who did not
drink at all or men who drank less often.  It didn't matter
whether the men had beer, red wine, white wine or liquor.  The
men who regularly had a drink cut their heart attack risk by one-
third, while men who drank alcohol once or twice per week had a
16 percent reduction in their heart attack risk.  The researchers
hypothesize that regular moderate drinking helps the heart by
thinning the blood, the same reason that aspirin does, the AP
says.  However, the researchers say that their findings apply
only to moderate drinking; heavy drinking is associated with a
number of other serious health problems.

The Flu's A Killer

Influenza is killing more Americans per year than AIDS. That's
what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say in a
report published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.  The flu-related death toll has quadrupled since the
late 1970s, the CDC says.  The agency mostly attributes this rise
to the aging of the American population.  Older adults are at a
higher risk for flu-related complications, and the flu vaccine is
often ineffective for people 65 and older, The Associated Press
reports.  The CDC also notes that the vaccination rate is low
among younger people who could benefit from the inoculation.
Another factor could be the emergence of a more lethal strain of
the flu virus, the AP says.

Obesity Shortens Life

Too many extra pounds can take years off your life.  Two recent
studies have linked obesity at different ages to lower life
expectancy.  One study, published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, analyzed surveys of more than 14,000
Americans and found that obesity at age 20 cut years from
people's life expectancy, depending on their race, sex, and the
severity of obesity.  In the most dramatic results, the
researchers found that black men with a body mass index (BMI) of
45 or more at age 20 cut 20 years from their life expectancy, The
Associated Press reports.  A smaller Dutch study of 3,457 people
found that being overweight at age 40 cut as many years from a
person's life as smoking did.  In that study, published in the
Annals of Internal Medicine, people who were overweight at 40
lost about three years of life, and those who were obese lost
even more years.  Obese smokers had the greatest reductions in
life expectancy.  The AP quotes experts who say the findings show
that people need to maintain a healthy weight starting early in
life.

Blood Pressure Risk At Birth

High blood pressure may be a birthright for some people.  A
German study published in the New England Journal of Medicine
suggests that people born with fewer filters than normal in their
kidneys -- a condition caused when a mother does not consume
enough protein during pregnancy -- may be more susceptible to
high blood pressure later in life.  The study was small; it
looked at only 20 young men who had died in accidents.  Half the
men had high blood pressure and half did not.  The researchers
found that the men with healthy blood pressure had two to three
times more filtering blood vessels in their kidneys than the men
with high blood pressure.  The kidneys of the men with
hypertension tended to be much bigger, a sign that the organs
were overworked, the researchers found.  One implication of the
study is that women need to be sure to eat a healthy diet during
pregnancy to prevent this condition in their children, the
researchers say.  The findings also suggest that the best way to
treat high blood pressure may be with a combination of diuretics
and drugs to lower pressure in the kidney's filters.
