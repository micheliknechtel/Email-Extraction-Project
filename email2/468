BIOGRAPHY LOOKS AT TOM SELLECK
Tuesday, January 14 at 8pm / 7CT

Biography: Tom Selleck traces the actor's rise from a Valley boy and male 
model to the star of Magnum, P.I. With unique access to Selleck family home 
movies, the program features candid moments of Tom and his family before he 
became a star. Other rare clips include Selleck's early commercial work, his 
1967 appearance on The Dating Game, and a clip of his performance on the 
soap opera The Young and the Restless. 

Biography: Tom Selleck also reports on how Steven Spielberg and George 
Lucas offered Tom the part of Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark, only to 
lose him to Magnum P.I. Tom starred as a Vietnam veteran turned private 
investigator in Hawaii, for which he won a 1984 Emmy. After Magnum's eight 
year run, Tom pursued a film career full time, his most popular one being 
Three Men and a Baby. Today Tom continues to make movies, including a role 
in the TV movie Monte Walsh set to premiere in January 2003. Tom speaks 
candidly about false tabloid stories about his sexuality and Rosie O'Donnell's 
attack on his support of the NRA. The program includes interviews with Tom's 
mother Martha Selleck, brothers Bob and Dan Selleck; sister Marti; wife Jillie 
Mack Selleck; Magnum co-stars Roger E. Mosley and Larry Manetti; Magnum 
supervising producer Charles Floyd Johnson; movie co-stars Bess Armstrong, 
Ted Danson and Sam Elliott; and producer Stephen J. Cannell.

CHUCK BARRIS: A DANGEROUS IMAGINATION
Thursday, January 16 at 8pm / 7CT

Before The Real World or Survivor, before Jerry Springer and Jenny Jones, 
there was Chuck Barris: "The King of Shlock," "The Baron of Bad Taste," and 
the godfather of reality television. Biography: Chuck Barris: Dangerous 
Imagination profiles the quirky mastermind behind such classic shows as The 
Dating Game and The Gong Show." He produced some of the most successful - 
and bizarre - programs ever seen on television, but off-camera, he was far 
different - a soft spoken, melancholy entrepreneur who, he claims, was a CIA 
assasin in the 1960s. Is the story real?

BENEDICT ARNOLD: A QUESTION OF HONOR
Monday, January 13 at 8pm / 7CT

He was one of America's greatest patriots, until love turned him into a traitor.
Join us for an A&E Original Movie starring Aiden Quinn and Kelsey Grammer 
that traces the events leading to the betrayal by one of the Continental Army's 
most decorated soldiers.

Before his very name became a synonym for "traitor," Benedict Arnold was 
not only George Washington's finest Revolutionary War officer, but one of his 
most trusted advisors and closest friends. How Arnold came to turn on his 
comrade, mentor and leader is a story as intriguing and commanding as the two 
legendary Generals themselves.
