<b>WAGE PREMIUMS FOR ON-THE-JOB COMPUTER USE: A METRO AND NONMETRO ANALYSIS</b><p>

An analysis of on-the-job computer use shows that such use is more common in metro areas than in nonmetro areas. A substa=
ntial wage premium, 10 to 11 percent, is associated with using a computer on the job, even after other job and worker cha=
racteristics are taken into account. However, this wage premium accounts for only a small proportion of the wage differen=
ces between metro and nonmetro areas. In nonmetro areas, the computer use wage premium is only about 6 percent.
