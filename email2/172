23 Ideas for 2003 | by Fast Company
Strategy. Marketing. People. Execution. The new 
business conversation starts here. Presenting 23 
bright ideas for a stellar 2003, from "silos of 
expertise" to data-donor cards.<P>

Here's one idea from Jeff Taylor, Founder and 
chairman, Monster.com:<P>

We all need to go into the corn-storage business. 
By that, I mean developing "silo expertise" in 
emerging business areas -- such as health care, 
government, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals 
-- that haven't gotten much attention in the past five 
years. Those are the places where money is still 
being spent. 

We're using that approach at Monster. For 
example, 71% of federal-government workers will 
be eligible to retire over the next eight years. My 
conclusion: I have to figure out how to do business 
with the U.S. government. So I put employees in a 
number of different departments who wear a 
government-solutions name badge. They 
represent a silo of expertise that's going to help 
me win that business. 

Call them "silos" or "niches," "business units," 
"communities," or "channels." I like "silo" because 
it represents a harvest. The market-place in 2003 
is more specialized, competitive, and focused. If 
you want to harvest revenue, then you'll have to get 
into the silo business. You'll have to build 20 of 
them, each with a different expertise. Then, 
depending on the size of your business, you could 
make $5 million or $300 million in one of those 
silos and substantially increase your revenue 
productivity. 

What does this mean for each of us? We can't be 
generalists anymore. If you want to have a chance, 
you need to be a specialist. Be bold about your 
industry or niche expertise. If you've been in 
pharmaceutical sales, trumpet your expertise in 
the industry, not just your sales skills. You need to 
become a silo yourself. <P>
