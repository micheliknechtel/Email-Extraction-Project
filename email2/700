Who wants to have lunch?  I'm going to be in Washington, DC the
weekend of January 25 and would love to meet some of the Recitopians
from that part of the world.  If you would like to get together for
lunch (or possibly dinner) while I'm in town, please let me know.  I
don't have the exact where and when worked out yet, but we can worry
about that as the date draws nearer.  If you are interested, please
drop me a line and I'll keep you posted of my plans as they develop.

            TODAY'S RECIPE
__________________________________________________


This salad is as delightful to the eye as it is to the palate.  It can
be made the day ahead and served at room temperature, or make it at
the last minute and serve warm.

Southwestern Seafood Salad

3 plum tomatoes, cored
1/2 cup (125 ml) dry white wine or water
2 bay (laurel) leaves
1/2 lb (225 g) shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 lb (225 g) scallops
2 cups orzo or other small pasta, cooked according
to package directions and drained
1 16-oz (450 g) can black beans, drained
1 cup (250 ml) cooked fresh or drained canned corn
2 Tbs (30 ml) fresh lime or lemon juice
2 Tbs (30 ml) chopped fresh parsley
2 Tbs (30 ml) chopped fresh cilantro (coriander leaves)
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
Cayenne pepper or hot sauce to taste (optional)

Cook the whole tomatoes in a dry skillet over high heat until
blackened on all sides.  Allow to cool, then discard the seeds and
chop coarsely.  Combine the wine and bay leaves in a skillet with a
cover over moderate heat and bring to a simmer.  Add the shrimp and
poach covered until they are pink and firm to the touch, 5 to 8
minutes.  Add the scallops and poach covered for an additional 2 to 3
minutes, just until the scallops are opaque and firm to the touch.
Remove the shrimp and scallops with a slotted spoon.  Combine with the
chopped tomatoes and the remaining ingredients in a large serving
bowl.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  Serves 4 to 6.

            KITCHEN TIP
__________________________________________________


Thanks to reader Susan Rooney of Elgin, SC for today's helpful hint:

If you have a self-cleaning oven, take the racks out and use a wadded
up piece of wax paper and rub it all over the racks after the clean
cycle is over.  They should slide right back in without discoloring, etc.

If you have a handy solution to a common kitchen problem,
please send it to mailto:Tips@wwrecipes.com

             ASK THE CHEF
__________________________________________________


P. Gardner asks: I have recently sanded down my 25-year-old walnut
cutting board.  Now I am wondering what to oil it with.  Have read the
labels on oils suggested to me such as linseed and tung but find no
recommendation to use them near food.  Suggestions from you, please,
Chef

The Chef answers: The only oil I would recommend for seasoning your
wooden cutting board is mineral oil.  It is non-toxic (it's actually sold in
the laxative section of drug stores), and since it is inorganic, it won't
turn rancid over time.

Send your questions on any topic, no matter how serious or silly,
to mailto:AskTheChef@wwrecipes.com - I can't answer them all,
but I'll publish one every day whether I know the answer or not.

My family ate at a Chinese Buffet last night and they had Peanut
Butter Chicken.  I had never heard of it before, but it was very good,
so I'm wondering if anyone has a recipe for this dish.  Please no
websites, prefer tired and true only.  Thanks in advance to all.

From: Alicia  mailto:amurphy@montana.edu
Hope everyone had a wonderful holiday.  I am looking for interesting,
tried-and-true low carbohydrate recipes.  I am on the Atkin's Diet and
am getting a little sick of steak and salads!  Thanks in advance!

From: Debe  mailto:Debe22@w3az.net
I am allergic to sugars, starches and yeasts and am running out of
ideas for good meals.  Any help would be appreciated.  I cannot eat
most fruits and vegetables with high sugar contents mostly the
nightshades.  Thank you.

From: Audrey  mailto:afhaggerty@yahoo.com
Anyone with some dinner menu ideas and authentic German recipes to go
with those ideas?  Thanks.  And thanks to all who helped me out with
the Jewish brunch.  We served potato latkes with applesauce and sour
cream, fresh fruit mixture, an assortment of bagels and cream cheeses,
sugar cookies cut out in Jewish Symbols, and That Cake.  Had punch,
coffee and tea available as well as nuts.  Again thanks to all who
helped me out with that one.  Everyone liked it.  The speaker did stay
for the brunch also.  She just couldn't resist the smell of those
latkes.

SPELL TO BE SAID UPON DEPARTURE

What was come here to do
having finished,
shelves of the water lie flat.

Copper the leaves of the doorsill,
yellow and falling.
Scarlet the bird that is singing.

Vanished the labor, here walls are.
Completed the asking.
Loosing the birds there is water.

Having eaten the pears.
Having eaten
the black figs, the white figs. Eaten the apples.

Table be strewn.
Table be strewn with stems,
table with peelings of grapefruit and pleasure.

Table be strewn with pleasure,
what was here to be done having finished.
