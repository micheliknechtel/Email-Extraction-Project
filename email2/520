Hoaxed For The Holidays?
FBI WITHDRAWS LOOKOUT FOR FIVE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
Reuters

The FBI is calling off a search for five men who it had said entered
the United States illegally last month because it now believes it was
given false information, a law enforcement official said on Tuesday.
The official said the FBI would remove an alert posted on the FBI site
on Dec. 29 which showed pictures of the five and said the agency was
seeking information on them in connection with the U.S. war on
terrorism.

Journalist Pays A Price For Protecting His Source
PA ARRESTS AL-JAZEERA MAN WHO REPORTED FATAH LINK TO TEL AVIV ATTACK
Ha'aretz (Israel)

Palestinian Authority security forces announced Monday the arrest of an
Al-Jazeera TV correspondent in the Gaza Strip for refusing to reveal
the source of his information in the Fatah-affiliated Al-Aqsa Martyrs'
Brigades, which took responsibility for Sunday evening's lethal terror
attacks in Tel Aviv, in which at least 23 people were killed.
Al-Jazeera officials stated Monday that correspondent Seif al Din
Shahin had been arrested in his Gaza office, after the satellite
television station aired a telephone interview conducted with an
Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades operative.

Do You Have A Claim?
FEW CLAIMING CD SETTLEMENT MONEY
Associated Press

Suppose someone was handing out $20 bills and almost nobody wanted one?
That's roughly what's happening with a massive price-fixing settlement
involving states and compact disc companies. The deal calls for
payments of as much as $20 for customers who bought CDs between 1995
and 2000. But so far, only a few people have signed up, and officials
fear the money will go begging.

PETA LAUNCHING BOYCOTT OF KFC
Associated Press

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said Monday it is launching
a boycott against KFC because of alleged animal-rights abuses by the
chain of fried-chicken restaurants. The Norfolk-based animal rights
group said it has tried for nearly two years to persuade KFC's parent
company, Yum Brands Inc. of Louisville, Ky., to change the way it
raises and slaughters chickens.

A man who says he spent more than $330,000 on his fiancee, buying her a
fur coat, a Vera Wang wedding dress and a 9-plus-carat diamond ring, is

for Mary Toon, 54.

They're Mad As Hell, And They're Not Gonna' Take It Anymore
JURIES "SEND A MESSAGE": WHY THE FUTURE OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES
MAY ONLY GROW BRIGHTER
FindLaw Columnist Anthony Sebok

Will President Bush and the Republican Congress kill off punitive
damages for good? Don't hold your breath, warns FindLaw columnist and
Brooklyn law professor Anthony Sebok. Sebok explains why a recent Ohio
Supreme Court decision indicates that while courts are uncomfortable
with juries using punitive damages to "send a message," that phenomenon
may only be growing.

A Norwegian teen-ager who created a computer program to copy Hollywood
movies was cleared of piracy charges Tuesday in a "David and Goliath"
trial pitting him against the industry's biggest studios. The Oslo

As digital file sharing, webcasting and other new technologies
proliferate, artists and industry officials meeting here said the music
business is in jeopardy unless artists, record companies and consumers
stop fighting and start compromising.  "People are always looking for
what side to be on, and there isn't just one side," said Jenny Toomey,
executive director of the Future of Music Coalition, which sponsored
this week's policy summit.

Why "No" Means "No"
COURT SAYS SEX AFTER RESCINDED CONSENT IS RAPE
San Francisco Chronicle

The California Supreme Court clarified the definition of rape Monday,
ruling that a person commits rape if he continues to have intercourse
with someone who initially consented to have sex but then changed her
mind.  Nothing in state law "suggests that the defendant is entitled to
persist in intercourse once his victim withdraws consent," wrote
Justice Ming Chin in the court's opinion.

Anchorage Daily News

According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, he is among about
500 Alaskans who have received patents since 1996. Many of their
inventions -- from a helmet light for snowmobilers to a tube that makes
it easier to bury the dead in permafrost -- have a decidedly Northern
focus . . . [O]ne of [Anchorage patent agent Mike] Tavella's most
successful clients is Darryl Fenton of Wasilla, inventor of the Poop
Moose candy dispenser. Lift the wooden moose's head and it emits M&M's
from its rear. Think what you want, but he's sold more than 100,000 of
them, mostly through a licensing agreement with a Kodiak man who got
them on the cable TV shopping channel QVC.

PAINT CAN TO THE HEAD PREVENTS ROBBERY
Associated Press

Three store clerks and a paint can were enough to stop an armed robber
last weekend. A Florida man, armed with a gun, walked into the Family
Dollar store at a shopping center Saturday and told two workers to give
him the cash in their registers. They complied, and the robber ordered
them to lock the door. But then a third clerk in the back charged the
thief and hit him in the head with a paint can . . .
