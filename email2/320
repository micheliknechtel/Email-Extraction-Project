TeachersFirst Update =96 January 13, 2003

The Real Martin Luther King
First off, a correction. Last week in this space we inadvertently gave a
link to an incomplete version of our new =93Remembering Martin Luther
King=94 unit. Our thanks to the many users who pointed out our goof, and
we apologize for the error. The correct link is:
http://www.teachersfirst.com/share/mlk/

Students and Stress
Do you have a student who seems overly worried and stressed about school
work or peer relationships? These students are often candidates for some
sort of informal stress management activities. You, and your student=92s
parents, can learn more from this month=92s feature TeachersAndFamilies
feature article, =93Childhood Stress: How Parents Can Help.=94 It offers
practical suggestions to help students better cope with school and other
activities. It=92s one of many helpful articles for parents on our
companion site. The URL is:
http://www.teachersandfamilies.com/open/parent/stress1.cfm

Show Your Hangups!
Last fall we published a collection of sayings and quotations on topics
like writing, leadership, and learning. TeachersFirst users printed
thousands of these for use in their classrooms. These =93hangups=94 are
still available, and they=92re great for inspiring and motivating student=
s
=96 and teachers too! You can find our hangups at:
http://www.teachersfirst.com/hangups.html

Hand Out a Compliment
Education courses call it =93positive reinforcement,=94 but we all know t=
hat
sometimes a student just needs a pat on the back. Next time you want to
acknowledge good work, try one of our TeachersFirst Supergrams. It=92s a
simple, type and print way to create a glowing comment about a student =96=

suitable for display on the appropriate refrigerator. Supergrams are
easy to use: just type, click, and print. They=92re part of our
TeachersFirst handouts page, at:
http://www.teachersfirst.com/handouts.html

Webquest Collection
Webquests are one of the best ways to let students explore and draw
connections about topics. Webquests can range from a simple =93walk
around=94 to a complex =93treasure hunt=94 involving dozens of sites and =
fact.
These sites change constantly, but we=92ve collected some of the best
webquests in the TeachersFirst webquests collection. While you=92re there=
,
try our Webquests 101 tutorial and learn how to create your own quest.
The webquest collection is at: http://www.teachersfirst.com/webquest.htm

Featured Sites
This weeks features include an animated ancient history site,  a
collection of folk tales to read to primary students, a California gold
rush site, and lots more. They=92re in the usual place:
http://www.teachersfirst.com/feature.htm

That will do it for this week. Remember, we=92re adding new resources
every day, so we hope you=92ll visit TeachersFirst regularly. And
remember, you do make a difference.

Senior Editor
