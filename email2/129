            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are ready. We are prepared. You'll be=
 fighting not to conquer anybody but to liberate people... Wherever you=
 serve or wherever you may be sent, you can know that America is gratef=
ul and your commander-in-chief is confident in your abilities and proud=
 of your service... I also know without a doubt that every order I give=
 will be carried out with skill and unselfish courage. We know the chal=
lenges and the dangers we face. Yet this generation of Americans is rea=
dy. We accept the burden of leadership. We act in the cause of peace an=
d freedom and in that cause we will prevail... The stakes are great. Th=
e terrorists have shown what they intend for us. And we're not going to=
 forget."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Bush, rallying U.S. troops who might see ac=
tion against Iraq at Fort Hood, Texas<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The president's proposed $1 billion increase in what=
 he claims is his top domestic policy priority leaves over 5 million ne=
edy children behind. The president's proposal may provide the money to =
test our children, but not enough to teach them. It's wrong to ask scho=
ols to do better on pocket change. Ask any teacher, parent, or school o=
fficial if the Bush administration is providing enough resources to car=
ry out needed school reforms, and the answer is no... Reform without re=
sources is just hollow talk - not the real improvement our children nee=
d and deserve. The president's proposal may provide the money to test o=
ur children, but not enough to teach them. It's wrong to ask schools to=
 do better on pocket change, especially as states face $68 billion shor=
tfalls."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., calling the president's=
 request to Congress to boost education aid to poor students by nearly =
nine percent inadequate, with an emphasis on testing which fuels an ove=
rload of tests, wastes instructional time and stifles broader learning<=
br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot is being spent - and a lot is being expected. =
Democrat leaders have repeatedly said they want more spending than the =
president has proposed, but they've never explained where the money wou=
ld come from."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rep. John Boehne, R-Ohio, supporting the president's =
request for  $1 billion more for federal programs to educate poor child=
ren<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The plan the president is considering would almost e=
xclusively go to the wealthiest Americans. Anyone who makes more than $=
1 million a year would get a tax break of $24,000. People making betwee=
n $40,000 and $50,000 a year would get $76... The president's plan won'=
t help middle income families, it won't contribute to economic growth, =
it won't make our homeland more secure, it won't expand educational opp=
ortunities for the young or strengthen Social Security for the elderly.=
 Instead, by putting us deeper into deficit and debt, it makes all of t=
hese things harder to achieve."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, denouncing=
 as "misguided" President Bush's pending tax-cutting plan to stimulate =
the economy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Given that Senator Daschle has already found fault w=
ith a proposal he hasn't even seen, it's clear he's more interested in =
politics than helping people. The president looks forward to helping Re=
publicans and Democrats alike who want to create jobs and accelerate gr=
owth."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan, indicating th=
e president was assembling an economic plan to strengthen growth, creat=
e jobs and help people who are hurting<br>
