What You Need To Know About Food &amp; Drink
 From Heather Klein, your Editor and Guide

 --------------------------- EDITOR'S NOTE ----------------------------
 One of my goals this year is to learn to make bread from scratch -- and learn to make it well. I've had a breadmaker for a while, which I like, but there's something very appealing to me about the idea of making bread myself. Carroll's Bread Making 101 article is very helpful for getting started. Bon appetit!

 ------------------------- IN THE SPOTLIGHT ---------------------------
 Bread Making 101

 -Desserts/Baking Guide Carroll Pellegrinelli
 Making bread from scratch is worth the time. Here are the step by step instructions for baking bread.

 White Tea

 -Coffee/Tea Guide Sean Paajanen
 You've tried black teas and green teas, and maybe even a few oolong teas. But have you tried the rare white tea yet? Low in caffeine, but big on healthy benefits, this variety of tea shouldn't be ignored.

 Fun Gift Ideas from your Chinese Cuisine Guide
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/BAO
 When a gift-giving occasion rolls around, my family frequently gives me little goodies that reflect my love of Chinese cooking. (My favorite gift is a pair of pajamas decorated with chopsticks). For Mother&#146;s Day, here are some interesting gift ideas for moms who enjoy Asian food &#150; but nothing that requires going near the kitchen!
 1. Yixing Teapots 
 (Alright, this one does require a trip to the kitchen, but hopefully someone besides mom will do the honors). Made from purple clay, Xixing Teapots are famous throughout Asia for their tea brewing capabilities. The clay absorbs the flavor of the tea; legend has it that you can brew a passable cup of tea from a seasoned Yixing teapot by simply adding water. 
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/BAL
 2. Bamboo Plant Gift Basket 
 According to legend, a gift of bamboo will bring good luck to the recipient. Native to South-east Asia, this relative of the citrus is known for its distinctive sword-shaped leaves. Selections include everything from a basic potted plant to a bamboo forest fountain, complete with smooth blue river stones. 
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/BAM
 3. Moon Bunnies
 According to a charming legend, we have the rabbit to thank for the annual Autumn Moon festival, which Asians around the world celebrate by admiring the harvest moon and enjoying delicious mooncakes. Designed to be used in the garden, these all-weather aluminum bunnies would add an authentic touch to any Moon Festival celebration &#150; but why not set them up now to enjoy throughout the summer?
