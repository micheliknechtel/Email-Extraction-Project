Thanks for the info y'all.

I had the throttle body and injectors cleaned at 62K.  Ended up being the #4
coil pack being bad at 62K.  This "missing" only occurs at idle, no matter
what accessories are on or off.  At speed there is nothing noticeable as
when the coil pack went...
Any other ideas?

"I have a 2000 Expy XLT with the 4.6.  I'm at 65K miles now, and have
noticed
at idle, what almost appears to be a miss or stutter with the engine.  The
RPM's don't fluctuate, but you can definitely feel it.

Has anyone else encountered this, and if so, what was the diagnosis - or is
it just inherent to the POS electronics of the engine...?"

One way to mediate hum is to play with the volume on both devices. For 
instance, if I crank the volume all the way up on my Zen, I don't need much 
car volume, but there's a noticable acoustic "noise floor" in the 
background. If I set the volume on the Zen to 15 out of 25, then set the 
volume with the head unit, I don't have that problem.

I really want a new stereo system - with a set of RCA inputs so I can buy 
one of those 120GB MP3 changers!

Thanks for letting use know what type of bulb was actuallyy in your fog
lights. Now I  wonder what is in my 2003. The owner's guide for my 2003
calls out the same bulb as the 2002 owner's guide. I imagine it is also
wrong and then my Expedition also uses 9145 H10 bulbs.

I saw a couple of semi-interesting references to the 9145 H10 Bulbs and have
listed them below -

http://www.sylvania.com/auto/pdfs/9000.pdf

http://www.gelighting.com/na/litlib/techsheet.html - This one is interesting
because it mentions that the 9145 is based on the  9005/9006 which I believe
LJC already alluded to. In the Ford Truck Enthusiast Forum I saw it
mentioned that the 9145 and 9005 had the same base except for the location
of a keying plug. I suppose you could modify the hosing and use a 9005 bulb,
but this might not be as easy as it sounds.

http://www.brightheadlights-hid.com/hid-ford.htm - These guys actually list
9145 as the fog light bulbs for a 2002 Expedition.

I think maybe someone at Ford confused the bulb number with the number of
"lumens." According to at least one source a 9145 H10 bulb has an output of
850 lumens.

I suppose if you really want bright fog lights (and I personally don't think
this is a good idea), you might want to look at
http://www.brightheadlights-hid.com/Fog_Lights.htm . If you install these
lights, please don't leave them on in traffic. The normal sort of wimpy fog
lights that many SUV drivers leave on, even on clear nights, are already
offensive enough.

I never could find any "bright" 9145 Bulbs. Maybe they don't exist.

Regards,

Ed White

It's not always a coil pak...A dealer in Maryland replaced my #4 plug & wire
at 60,000 (long story, and it was not the problem). At just over 100,000 I
got a flashing check engine light and bad miss on the way to work one
morning. Another dealer found the #4 plug loose, and the compression had
blown the wire off. The first dealer who replaced the plug needlessly
apparently did not properly torque it down.

I've got a Sony cassette adapter that came with my old Walkman that has
worked great in both the wife's Voyager and now in the Expy. We use it with
my laptop to allow the kids to watch DVD's while on the road. One of the
things the Sony manual said about the adapter was to place the volume no
higher than 3/4" range or possible audio distortion would be detected. I've
never experienced the hum problem, but then the Expy's sound system is just
the Premium type with no subwoofer. However, the sound system sounds
incredible when watching Ice Age, Lord of the Rings or James B. movies. The
girls also like the 15" screen a lot better than those dinky 7" screens that
are foisted on the current vehicles for an entertainment system!

Just wondering how you get 'hum' in the system when there no real source of
60 cycle AC in a automobile. The alternator would be puting out a mid-range
whine, and any computer oscillator circuits would be generating frequency
sounds much to high to hear.

Michael,

My wife and I are considering a better video system for our Expy.  (We
currently have the Backseat Theater (www.backseattheater.com).  Its OK, but
with our expanding family, it will soon not be.  

Anyway, we've been considering that laptop option because that seems to have
so much more versatility (i.e. - when we're not on a trip, its not sitting
in the garage unused).

Do you secure your laptop and if so, how are you doing that?  I don't want a
projectile in the cabin in the event of a sudden stop.

Any other ideas out there?  A laptop just seems much more practical than a
portable dvd player or adding more 7" mini screens to the vehicle.

Here is what I did. Bought an lcd flat monitor Digital Research, there are other brands available, SHARP comes to mind, ( http://www.dr-tech.com/products/dr-lcd15tv.asp); a mobile ac/dc Rosen dvd player and had the Audiovox whs200a (http://www.audiovox.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ExecMacro/product_mainpage.d2w/input?prrfnbr=936487) infrared headphone system installed. With this setup, the TV and DVD player can be removed for viewing in the house. The Audiovox whs200a is a dual input system. I (the driver) can listen to my preference (AM/FM/CD) and the rear seat passengers can listen to 2 different sources or the same thing I am listening to by plugging the whs200a into the factory rear headphone jack if they desire. The TV is powered by an inverter plugged into one of the power points.

Michael,

My wife and I are considering a better video system for our Expy.  (We currently have the Backseat Theater (www.backseattheater.com).  Its OK, but with our expanding family, it will soon not be.  

Anyway, we've been considering that laptop option because that seems to have so much more versatility (i.e. - when we're not on a trip, its not sitting in the garage unused).

Do you secure your laptop and if so, how are you doing that?  I don't want a projectile in the cabin in the event of a sudden stop.

Any other ideas out there?  A laptop just seems much more practical than a portable dvd player or adding more 7" mini screens to the vehicle.


I've got a Sony cassette adapter that came with my old Walkman that has worked great in both the wife's Voyager and now in the Expy. We use it with my laptop to allow the kids to watch DVD's while on the road. One of the things the Sony manual said about the adapter was to place the volume no higher than 3/4" range or possible audio distortion would be detected. I've never experienced the hum problem, but then the Expy's sound system is just the Premium type with no subwoofer. However, the sound system sounds incredible when watching Ice Age, Lord of the Rings or James B. movies. The girls also like the 15" screen a lot better than those dinky 7" screens that are foisted on the current vehicles for an entertainment system!

Subject: RE: EXPEDITION: Question about Diesels

I believe diesel fuel (which is a lot closer to heating oil and jet fuel
than regular controlled ignition engine fuel) usage by trucks and farm
equipment represents a small fraction of the heavy fuel production. Most of
it goes to furnaces and other applications where contaminants are not as
much of a problem, so the refineries don't care as much and shift the burden
of filtering on the consumers who need it. In addition, the diesel fuel
being less refined than regular fuel tends to have more of the heavier
products of cracking (such as wax) which clog filters more easily. As ED
pointed out, this is likely to be more variable depending on where you get
your diesel fuel from.

Ed, how long do you last with 1500 gallons? I would guess you probably do
not want to keep diesel fuel more than a few months anyway to limit the risk
of deposits in your tank.

I think replacing fuel filters on a diesel is very dependent on the where
you get your fuel. For whatever reason it seems diesel fuel is delivered
with more contaminants than gasoline. Until about 10 years ago we bought
diesel fuel for our farm in 300 gallon lots. At one point things got so bad
that we were replacing the fuel filters on the tractors 2 or 3 times a year.
We finally got wise and installed a filter on the tank. After that all our
fuel filter problems vanished. I still change the ones on the tractors
yearly, but I rarely see anything in the bowls (the tractors all use
cartridge type filters). Also, we now buy the diesel fuel in 1500 gallon
lots. I would guess most gas stations include a filter in the dispensing
line which should remove a lot of the contaminants.

Here in NYC i was just at a car wash/car radio shop (its pretty big car

like the small monitors being installed.  Im sure it was made for SUV owners
because who else would put such a large monitor in their cars. One of those
would be perfect as the second and third row people can see it perfectly.
the only person who might have problems seeing is the driver! Might as well

1500 gallons lasts me about 1 year, more or less. I have a filter on the
tank and have never really had a problem with fuel contamination. Farm fuel
does not have the same low sulfir requirements as road diesel and is closer
to home heating fuel.

Thanks for the info y'all.

I had the throttle body and injectors cleaned at 62K.  Ended up being the #4

what accessories are on or off.  At speed there is nothing noticeable as

Any other ideas?

Subject: EXPEDITION: Speaking of coil packs...

I had the #4 coil pack go bad about 30K ago.  I didn't have time to
troubleshoot the problem, so I let Ford do it.  They soaked me for the coil
pack, a full set of plugs, since they said they were there anyway, and a
computer diagnostic.  (Since then, I no longer use Ford service as my
brother works at a shop with a lift, and I can use it any Wednesday / Sunday
when they are closed) I can TRUST him and the work he SAYS he does.

Driving home last Friday through some heavy rain, I ran through some pretty
deep waters.  The engine started running rough, and on came the service
engine lite.  I pulled the codes and found a misfire on #6.  On inspection,
I found the #6 coil pack loose because the bolt that secures it was broken
flush with it's hole.  The spark plug hole was full of water, causing the
misfire.  I was able to drill out the broken bolt and re-bolt the coil pack,
vacuum the water out of the hole, and I was on my merry way.  I ran about
125 miles today so far and it runs good as new.

Since the bolt merely holds down the plastic coil pack and spark plug boot,
I can only assume that the idiots at the Ford dealership overtightened the
bolt when changing my plugs.  I couldn't find the top of the bolt anywhere,
and judging by the dirt and such, it looked like it had been broken for a
while.

Bottom line......dealers will screw you WHENEVER they can.

Sorry for the rant.
