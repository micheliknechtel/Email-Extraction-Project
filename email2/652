Welcome to another edition of Dead End. 

You will notice that I included quite a lengthy obituary for 
Mario "Motts" Tonelli. A resident of the Chicago area, Tonelli's 
story has been inspirational to not only those who live there, 
but athletes and individuals around the world. His story is a 
remarkable one that deserves to be told. I recommend that you 
do further reading on his exploits. His story might inspire you, 
if it hasn't already.

Until next time, reflect on these words: 
"Don't sacrifice your life to work and ideals. The most important 
things in life are human relations. I found that out too late." 
                --Katharinde Susannah Prichard Australian Author 

                            ****

MARIO "MOTTS" TONELLI, PRO FOOTBALL PLAYER, DEAD AT 84
Mario "Motts" Tonelli, the professional football player 
whose true integrity, perseverance and courage has inspired 
many, died Tuesday at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in 
Chicago. He was 84.

After being recruited to the University of Notre Dame, he 
became known as the fullback who could break through any line 
and run like lightening down the field. It was at Notre Dame 
that he received All American honors and made his famous run 
of 70 yards to help pull out an important win over rivals Uni-
versity of Southern California. After college Tonelli joined 
the then-Chicago Cardinals of the NFL. Before he could get his 
cleats dirty WWII called and he was off to war, where he found 
himself a prisoner of war for four years and forced into the 
Bataan Death March in the Philippines. Upon returning from war, 
he was almost 100 pounds lighter than his 200 pound former self, 
and infested with intestinal parasites and malaria. Despite doc-
tors orders, Tonelli returned to the field one last time so as 
to be eligible for his NFL pension. This not two months after 
his return. 

Following his football career Tonelli turned to politics. He 
gave inspirational speeches at local schools. A true inspiration, 
he was inducted into the Italian American Sports Hall of Fame a 
few months ago.

HENRY BOOTTERELL, LAST WWI COMBAT PILOT, DEAD AT 106
Henry Botterell, believed to be the last surviving World War I 
combat pilot, died Friday in a Toronto nursing home of old age. 
He was 106.

The son of a civil servant, Botterell was born and raised in 
Ottawa and educated at Lisgar Collegiate Institute. In 1916 
he was working for the Bank of British North America when he 
enlisted in the Royal Naval Air Service. After suffering an 
initial crash and some broken bones, Botterell reenlisted and 
was sent to Serny France in 1918. During the war he took down 
two German planes and several observation balloons. His most 
memorable attack on one balloon was captured by aviation
artist Robert Taylor in his painting called "Balloon Buster." 
After the war he returned to his job at the bank until he 
retired in 1961.
