                            -- From The Editor --

As we launch the second decade of our publication, we extend sincere New
Year greetings to all of our new and old readers.  We welcome several new
editors, including two faculty members from a Mainland Chinese university,
an important first for CCF.  For this premier issue of 2003, we are
pleased to be able to present contributions by readers from Nanjing,
Shanghai, Taiwan, and America, making this a true "Chinese Community
Forum."

While Chinese everywhere get ready to celebrate the lunar New Year, or the
Spring Festival, we share with our readers Jesse Hwa's delightfully
nostalgic narrative about Peking grand opera and Shaoshin folk opera.  We
continue to be impressed by Jesse's vivid memory of events that occurred
over six decades ago in Shanghai.  We invite our readers to respond to his
suggestion: "In so doing I hope to entice you Chinese opera fans to share
your knowledge and enjoyment of the art with the rest of us."

In early 2001 we published numerous compositions by junior students at
Ginling College in Nanjing.  Several of them are now pursuing graduate
studies at Chinese and American universities.  In her tender article, "Two
Roads Diverge in front of Me," using the poetic line by Robert Frost,
Daisy Xi describes her anxiety and puzzlement in choosing, and being
chosen by, a good faculty mentor.  We understand that such sentiments are
experienced by almost all graduate students in the School of Foreign
Languages and Cultures at Nanshida (Nanjing Normal University), and no
doubt other Chinese universities.

With the publication of commentaries by Irene, a reader from Shanghai, and
Jim Walsh, we hope to close out the recent rehash of the 1989 Tiananmen
Square events, a thread which has already been characterized by some as
"bizarre" or "weird."

1. Chinese Opera -- Old and New .............................. Jesse Hwa 175
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am not a Chinese opera fan, nor do I know much about Chinese opera. But
I can tell what little I know to some of my friends who may know nothing
about it. In so doing I hope to entice you Chinese opera fans to share
your knowledge and enjoyment of the art with the rest of us. My
recollection is an old man's privilege and pleasure.

A recent family event drew me into this. But first let me recall the old
days in China when I did see two or three Chinese opera performances. (I
never saw any more on stage since 1946 when I came to the U.S.)

Around 1940 my elder cousin took me to the biggest Chinese opera house in
Shanghai, called "Da Wu Tai" (The Big Theater). The hall was large, rather
noisy, and half lit. Big posters hanged on the walls announcing future
offerings, much like strip posters listing specialties of the day in some
Chinese restaurants. People chatted during performance and the cracking
sound of watermelon seeds was all over. Attendants brought boiling water
in a big kettle to refill tea cups. The most amazing "show," perhaps
during intermission, was that attendants served hot towel --- you can
order one. An attendant on the isle would wring a towel from a bucket of
very hot water, his hands turning white from handling and wringing. Then
he would throw the steaming towel maybe 20 or 30 feet away where another
attendant stood nearby the customer and caught the flying towel. I asked
my cousin if the man would miss. "Never." The musicians sitting on the
side of the brightly lighted stage were seesawing the ur-hu (Chinese
string instrument), banging away the wood percussions and gongs, blowing
the horns, while the actors, don in elaborate costumes, some with
peacock-featured headpieces, and holding wooden long spears, sang and
twirled away. That was Chinese Peking (or Grand) opera.

In those early years, the singing was in Mandarin and all actors were men,
including for female roles. A good actor would be judged in part by how he
could walk, talk or sing like a female. There were four all-time great
actors, the most famous being Mei Lang-fang. He was brought to America to
perform on Broadway in the early 30s.

As in some European theatrical programs, there were several performances
in succession, the minor ones coming first. Then later, when the theater
became quieter and the mothers and kids had left, the real heavyweight
performance began. It was in that occasion that I saw a complete
performance of Yu Tang Chun (name of the opera and the woman in the story)
in its entirety.  The leading role, Yu, was sung by another one of the
Great Four -- Sung Hui-Seng.  I still remember some details and tunes even
though it was over 60 years ago. That was grand opera at its full glory.

The story line was a scholar who visited a brothel on his way to Peking
for the imperial examination. There he met this woman Yu who took a liking
to him. (Remember girls in brothels were greatly honored to befriend men
of a higher station. There is a very tuneful Chinese song, the first
refrain of which says: "Good flower not often bloom; good man not often
come") Then someone in the brothel was poisoned to death and Yu was
wrongly accused. Later she was brought to trial by a magistrate who was
none other than that young scholar who years later became a high official.
So the heart of the opera was the trial where she knelt in front of the
three presiding judges, the middle and highest ranking one being her
former lover. But she did not recognize him while the other two judges
suspected or knew about the past event and teased the chief judge. Yu at
first was kneeling on a pad singing to the judges with her back to the
audience. Shortly an attendant walked onstage and turned her around to
face the audience. She then began a long singing sequence about her
innocence and her meeting with the young scholar who could bear witness.
At times the magistrate acted to reflect his embarrassment. Of course the
ending was happy. What a story! The songs were so tuneful that I could hum
away for years afterwards. The libretto, not in Imperial court language,
was easier to understand by the laymen, including me. The singing was
interrupted several times by loud HOW (Chinese bravo).

There is a lot more to Chinese grand opera than just the one I saw. From
what little I have read, Chinese grand opera is a stylized art form -- the
gestures, imaginary horses or carriages, opening or crossing of unseen
doors, paintings on the faces (blue for justice, red for bravery, white
for treachery). When it is about a court story, the libretto is literary
Chinese, rather hard to understand for most people. There are Chinese
opera fans today even in the U.S., listening to recordings or joining
amateur clubs, and they love to sing in public. In a recent St. John's
University alumni gathering, there was amateur Chinese opera singing, not
karaoke.

Since I came to U. S. and in my travels to China, I never saw another
opera again. But what brought me now to reflect on opera stems from a
recent Hwa brothers family reunion in California. There we talked about
our mother who lived in Shanghai until her passing in 1968. At that time,
her four sons were all in the U.S. She often wrote us enthusiastically
about Shao Shin opera which she and some of her old lady friends, also
fans, went to see often. In particular, she wrote about an actress, Ting
Sy-Chuin, whom she befriended and later adopted informally as her
daughter. Ting was acclaimed like Maria Callas in her glorious days in
China; her reputation was so red that it bordered purple, as the Chinese
put it.

I knew nothing about Shao Shin opera.  But curiosity struck us brothers in
that we should get hold of a video or DVD disk just to taste what our
mother craved all about. So we went to Chinatown and luckily found one.
Then we viewed it and now I wish to tell you about my impressions of it.

Shao Shin is a city in Zhejiang Province, south of Shanghai. It has a
distinct dialect akin to Shanghainese and the other dialects of the "lower
Yangtse," as Wuxi, Suchow, Ninpo, Hangchow. The dialect is pleasant and
soft in tone. I don't know whether Shao Shin opera has prospered for
hundreds of years, or only in recent years. Performed in old Chinese
costumes and sung in the Shao Shin dialect, it can be said as a folksy
opera. Just opposite to Peking opera, all performers are women.

I saw two disks. The first one is called "Liang San-Buh and Tso Ying-Tai"
(names of two people) which is dubbed as "The Butterfly Lovers" in
English. It is a folk story about Tso, the woman who disguised as a man
and studied for three years along with another man, Liang, who did not
know Tso's identity. They became good friends. Later Tso was called home
and before they departed, Tso revealed herself to her headmistress and
asked her to be the matchmaker as she loved Liang. But alas, after Tso got
home, she found her father had already promised her to another man. When
Liang went to visit Tso and found out about it, sorrow descended. He loved
her.  Afterwards Liang returned home and died of a broken heart. Tso found
out, went to his grave and killed herself. Then the two turned into
butterflies flying and singing happily. It is a love story, very moving
and very sad.  The singing, acting, and costumes, like in Peking opera,
are also very stylish. The libretto is still rather literary, meaning
that, like Shakespeare, it is not everyday language. Without Chinese
subtitles, I could hardly understand it. But the singing is very tuneful.
I must say I like it. No wonder my mother loved it and saw her
goddaughter's performance again and again.

It is interesting to read a comment on the disk jacket. The original
performance was filmed in 1954. The note says that in that year Shanghai
Mayor Cheng, after seeing this Shao Shin performance, proclaimed that it
showed "Revolutionary Love" and that for such artistic products, "Let
Hundred Flowers Bloom." Later in answering to Mao's query, the slogan --
"Let Hundred Flowers Bloom. Let Hundred Thoughts Contend" -- was born.

Knowing my enthusiasm, my sisters-in-law fed me with more Shao Shin disks
from Chinatown. I finished viewing another one after three treadmill
sessions. It is a comedy called "Three Visits to See Liu Jing-Ding,"
another folk tale -- about how Fung (played by my mother's goddaughter
Ting), chasing after Liu, the famed woman warrior. Liu was honored to be
named as the Royal Princess by the emperor but was forbidden to be seen by
the public. Fung, son of a magistrate, was determined to see Liu in
person. So he disguised himself and tricked his way, past Liu's two
ladies-in-waiting (very funny and well acted), and saw the princess three
times. They fell in love.  But her father was angry for being cheated by
Fung and ordered to behead Fung. Then Liu, dressed in her glorious warrior
garments and attended by her female fighters (very funny) came to the
rescue. But her father did not relent until finally an Imperial Order from
the Emperor came to exonerate Fung and bless the betrothal. This is a
happy folk tale. Well costumed, sung and enacted, the whole opera is
delightful.

I am fascinated by how the actresses and actors constantly adjusted their
draped long silk sleeves which vary in length, from a foot long to all the
way to the floor. The actresses flipped their arms a few times making the
silk sleeves to bunch up so neatly on their wrists, and then made
theatrical gestures with their fingers.

Another thing I noticed in both the Grand and Shao Shin operas is the very
effective musical accompaniment although there is no musical score or a
director. Those five or six musicians sit on the side of the stage, half
seen by the audience, and watch the performance on stage. Each musician
plays his instrument to follow or lead the acting or singing, yet in
consonance with others without a director. In some moments, using a stick
striking a wood block or lightly banging a small gong in measured timing
enhanced suspense, just like the musical background in Western movies.

Chinese opera is an art form that fans in and out of China still cater to.
The Chinese government tries to sustain it with schools similar to
Julliard.  But I am afraid it is declining in its appeal. Recently I
visited the "Great World" in Shanghai, a famous multi-entertainment center
for the masses before WWII, which has stayed the same today. The Chinese
opera section had just 15-20 old folks watching, while in another room two
young men, holding mikes and their guitars, shouted rock and roll to a
roomful of young and middle age people.

I must confess, as Andy Rooney would put it, that in spite of my nostalgia
of the old Chinese opera and the delightful discovery of the new, it is
hard to beat the moment when Jussi Bjorling sings "O soave fanclulla" (O
lovely maiden) in La Boheme or when Pavarotti blasts out the last two
notes in his signature aria "Nessun dorma" in Turandot -- a moment when my
heart throbs in ecstasy.

2. Two Roads Diverge in Front of Me ........................... Daisy Xi  71
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A hungry leopard goes at a deer.  Up clouds of dust stir.  The carnivore's
muscles roll.  His eyes glare with pride.  The frightened prey is doomed.
Suddenly, the leopard sprains his ankle and rolls over onto his back.  He
staggers to leave, his head drooping.  Dust disperses behind him.  This is
a memomotion shot in a desolate African forest by one zoologist.  He has
prepared for the shot for hundreds of hours.  He has watched a chance day
and night to capture the instant.  Cozily seated themselves in front of
TV, the audience appreciate the shot, marvel at the scientist's fortitude,
chuckle at his persistence and admire their own easy success.

Yu Qiuyu, a famous Chinese writer and scholar, used to compare human
social development to a crowded bus slowly pushed by a small group of
people.  Unconsciously or not, most people fall prey to conventions and
play a role as an audience of civilization.

People came to the world with a piece of blank paper, fresh, free,
fearless and flexible.  They "swam in the stream of their own
temperaments."  They admired the great, and dreamed of joining them and
giving the full measure of devotion to their society and the world.  Later
they were asked to draw a chick on the paper.  They were told that a
square stomach was wrong because the stomach could only be round.  A right
chick finished, more and more sophisticated drawings have been adding to
the paper, to fix their minds.  They feel bounded.  They dare not be
different.  They follow to take the road more traveled by others.  They
find themselves being chased by utility, by all kinds of desires: to get a
higher pay, better house equipment or a quicker promotion.  Career
requiring years of unknown studies is deserted.  They are sophisticated,
selfish and stiff.  They find themselves among the audience complacent
about their own comforts and much easier success.

Tragically, there is a margin on my paper.  Standing on the threshold of
the conventional world, i linger over the choice between two professors. I
am to choose a professor whose wisdom will illuminate my academic study
and whose character will influence my life.  It is to decide whether to
get off and join the small group to push the "bus" and work in the soul of
man or to be the audience and wait for easy comforts.

A body of knowledge, Professor A poses in the class as a Socrates.  He is
a liberal.  Instead of informing us of what is truth, he inspires us to
explore it, doubt it and make it.  However, most Chinese students have
been used to waiting for chewed knowledge, for others to push them
forward, just like the passengers in that bus of civilization.  So
unconventional is he that his way of delivering classes and his thinking
is misunderstood, his achievements unrecognized and his fame eclipsed.
Everyday the light in his study burns into midnight.  He alone gropes his
way on the long cold nights like that lonely anonymous zoologist!  To
become his student is to become a pagan like himself. being shut out of
dazzling beauty of the outside world.

As to Professor B, I am told that he is young, brilliant and promising.
Among his students his classes are popular.  In a teaching contest of last
year he won the first prize.  To be his student, as many believe, would
become a popular scholar.  But the choice agonizes me, for often the true
artist is a devoted fugitive, like that zoologist and the few who have
been pushing the bus.

"Two roads diverge in a wood, and I --"

The day before I was doing some reading at the library when a woman gave
me a piece of paper.  Bewildered, I found there were poems on it.  "It's
free," she simply added with a faint smile.  Then she quietly left.  I
turned to the poems and began to understand.  She was the poet.  She
expected to be read and recognized.  Her poems must have been refused, or
she would not have added that it was free.  But she still smiled.  A pale
but brave smile.  Later I found out I was the only person to whom she
delivered the poems.  Maybe it was because I sat by the door and was the
nearest person she could reach.

Another day I wondered alone at night.  Invisible in the darkness, I
bathed in the kisses of brisk winds and listened to the trees.  I felt
free as if I were flying high in the sky.

3. About Chen Gu ................................... Irene from Shanghai  38
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I read Chen Gu's article in the CCF issue of December 4, 2002, I
really felt like talking to him face to face.  Because I can't express
what I think by e-mail.  May be I was a little angry.  But then I thought
everybody should have the freedom to think and say whatever he thinks is
right. However, I think this Mr. Chen or Mr. Gu, as a scholar (it seems)
of Chinese Studies, should have a better basis for his thinking.

Independent thinking should be respected.  But only those thinking based
on facts could be valued.  Conclusions based on one's understanding of the
recordings from the media, as he himself realized, may not be correct.  I
think his viewpoint is "weird," as one of your editors put it.  The
Tiananmen problem is a big subject for study.  Viewpoints more close to
the facts should not be drawn without at least getting in touch with some
of the millions of people who were directly involved, and the study of the
struggle within the top ruling stratum and the international situation.

Mr.Chen said he was asked by the students about what would turn out from
the protest.  Whether it would lead to "fall like the Soviet Union".  Here
he made a mistake.  The time was before June 4th of 1989, the Soviet Union
had not yet "fallen down."  He should remember that the fall of Soviet
Union happened by the end of 1991, that was more than two years after the
time he was asked.  Since the Chinese society is very complicated, one
should not be too complacent, if he wants to be more like a scholar on
Chinese studies.

As to the relationship between the "spy scandal" and the "400,000
dissidents", I don't know how many among the 400,000 are spies, and would
there be no spies without the 400,000.  Is it normal for every country to
have some spies from other countries, including those work for the US?

As to the tank avoiding the man in front; does that indicate that the
driver was "humane" rather than that the "authorities" were humane?  I
have a friend who happened to live on West Changan Street in Beijing at
the time.  He was an eye witness to the entire events.  When I visited him
sometime later, I could still see bullet holes on the walls of his
building.  His son also saw the whole thing, but did not dare to discuss
with others.  Even now it is a taboo subject under tight political
control.

4. My Rebuttal ............................................... Jim Walsh  45
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Editors:

Thank you for continuing to provide a forum for differing viewpoints. My
most fundamental criticism of the CCP is that it forbids the free exchange
of views.

Mr. Chen Gu's latest missive (entitled My Rebuttal, in issue #2002-24)
involves so many bizarre statements that it is difficult to refute. Let me
simply point out the internal contradictions in what he says:

"Did the Protesters KNOW what they were doing?  It rather depended on what
they wanted to do in the first place. I certainly haven't heard of what
they wanted to do by such a protest."

Actually, the protestors debated what they wanted and then, jointly agreed
upon some detailed proposals. These were written in the form of a petition
which they gave to the government.

But even stranger, having said that he did NOT know what they wanted, he
goes on to say:

"I'll tell you this, "peaceful" MOST of them may be, the few leaders were
NUTS in their expectations. Either they wanted a "peaceful" revolution in
3 months, which would make them NUTS. Or they wanted blood shed revolution
in 3 months, which would make them fanatical and NUTS.  Or maybe they
didn't really know what they were doing, which would make their followers
and supporters NUTS."

Far from not knowing what they wanted, he claims to know what they wanted
in great detail, and criticizes what they wanted as "unrealistic".

In fact the demonstrators were not following leaders at all. Each and
every demonstrator participated in debates and voted. Of course there were
some whose speaking ability made them more well-known, but, in no sense of
the word were they the "leaders" nor were the other demonstrators "their
followers".

And if they had "unrealistic" ideas of what they could accomplish, so
what? Having unrealistic expectations is not a crime.

The TAM demonstrators had the human right to do what they did. And the CCP
murdered some of them in an attempt to discourage further exercises of
normal human rights.

Love, Jim
