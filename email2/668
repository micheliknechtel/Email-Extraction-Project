           Ticket Information for Wrestle Mania

Jesse Ventura recently commented on his WWE return. He was
quoted as as saying "It depends on whether Vince McMahon puts 
the decimal point in the right spot" 

To update Wrestlemania ticket sales, "Platinum" and "Gold" 
level seats are sold out. Most of the reserved seats are 
selling very quickly.

        Will UPN Continue To Carry SmackDown?

The current contract for WWE SmackDown! to air on UPN dis-
continues in August, more importantly SmackDown! maybe cut 
to one hour. If UPN decides to cancel WWE SmackDown! all 
together, the WWE would try to bring the show to either 
TNN or MTV networks. Although, TNN has stated on numerous 
occasions they do not want to be known as the wrestling 
network, take that for what it is worth.

By any odd chance if WWE SmackDown! was cut or reduced it 
would really hurt the WWE. Most of all it would really hurt 
the brand extension and cut backs on ad revenue, in which 
case next to PPVs, is the second biggest revenue stream for 
WWE.

             RAW's 10th Anniversary Special!

Enough WrestleMania tickets are sold at this point for WWE 
to announce a sellout. As of this writing, the only seats 
available are in the nose-bleed sections. Any wrestling fans 
who don't have the internet missed out this year, as tickets 
don't go on-sale to the general public offline until this 
Saturday. WWE will likely soon announce something along the 
lines of a five minute sellout.

Next Tuesday's RAW 10th Anniversary special at The World in 
Times Square, New York, has officially been changed from one 
hour to two full hours on TNN. Still no word on some of the 
bigger names who will be returning from the past, but Ron 
"The Truth" Killings, Bobby Heenan, "Mean" Gene Okerlund, 
and The Rock are the only rumored names floating around at 
this point.

           Could Irwin R. Schyster Return?

Goldust attended his grandmother's funeral yesterday prior 
to RAW. After the funeral and burial, Goldust got on an 
airplane and flew straight to RAW in Phoenix, Arizona so he 
and Booker T could drop the tag-titles.

Ron Simmons and Monty Sopp (Billy Gunn) are expected to 
become road agents in WWE soon. Both are unofficially, but 
very likely, done as full time wrestlers. There has been 
some internal discussions in WWE about bringing in Mike 
Rotundo (aka Irwin R. Schyster) in as a road agent as well.

WWE SmackDown! will be live in London, Ontario on February 
25th. RAW the day before will be in Toronto.

Roddy Piper is scheduled to appear on NWA-TNA's return pay-
per view tomorrow night. Others expected somewhat new talent 
expected to be there include the Road Warriors, Paul Bearer, 
and David Flair.

In some rather odd news, RAW wrestler Steven Richards will 
be hosting SmackDown! this Thursday at The World. In addition 
to that, SmackDown! wrestlers John Cena and B-Squared will be 
hostnig RAW next Monday night
