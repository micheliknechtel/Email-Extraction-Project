"I never did give anyone hell. I just told the truth and they
thought it was hell."
-Harry Truman

Dear Vorticians,

Please note: I need your views on an important issue. Consider it
a straw poll. See below.

Writing this newsletter each week has proven to be nothing short
of a cultural awakening. Between what I've learned in my
research and the Vortex conferences over which I've presided, as
well as the feedback from all of you in the Vortex community, I
am a broader man. Mentally, I mean. I've also broadened
physically over the past few years, but I don't choose to discuss
that.

Last week, I mentioned that February 1 would mark the start of
the Chinese New Year - the year of the sheep. My less-than
exhaustive research led me to believe - and to report - that
this would be a good year for those born in previous years of
the sheep. Well, sorry to disappoint, but Vortician Axel
Tillmann, the CEO of NOVILIT (with the intriguing tagline: Any
protocol. AnyWARE), set me straight in the following note:

"Dear John, unfortunately you are wrong to assume that the year
of the sheep is good for the sheep.  First of all, there are
four different sheep: wood, fire, water and metal.  And I have
to look up if 2003 is the year of the wood sheep or any of the
other three.  Chinese astrology actually believes that the year
of each sign will be a particular challenging one for the sign
itself.  The year of the sheep will be a particularly good one
for the horse, which stood the test of time of its own
challenging year in 2002.

"Anyhow, as you refer to your economic forecasts, the year 2003
will see the start of a moderate recovery around mid-year. This
is independent of the Gulf war, which we will be engaging in the
first week of February.  This will be followed by two strong
years, 2004 and 2005, and a sudden stop/decline in 2006. I see
many indicators pointing in this direction and I just wanted to
give you another perspective.  I will be looking forward to your
Vortex event in 2003."

Vortician Tillmann's letter is a grand slam - a perfect storm of
letters, if you will.

Not only did he clarify the Chinese astrology, he gave me his
prediction on the year ahead and told us when the Gulf war will
begin. Finally, and most important to yours truly and my
mortgage, he said he was "looking forward to your Vortex event
in 2003." Bless you, Vortician Tillmann. I hope you are all
looking forward to Vortex 2003, which will be held May 18-20 and
about which you can find detailed information at
www.idgexecforums.com/vortex.

After receiving V. Tillmann's missive, I went back to the Web
site and learned that the new year will be the year of the black
sheep, which neither sounds very good nor fits into the
categories V. Tillman laid out. I hope he will clarify and I
hope he will tell us why 2006 will mark a sudden decline in the
fortunes of the networking industry. Those of you born in the
years 1990 (unlikely, if you are reading this), 1978, 1966,
1954, 1942, 1930 and any other 12th year beyond that were born in
a year of the horse and things look good for you in '03. Enjoy.

Believe it or not, the actual focus of this week's Vortex Digest
is the Federal Communications Commission.

If you'll recall, one of the issues I cited in my year-end '02
wrap-up was the failure of regulatory or government officials to
take any substantial action to spur a rebirth in the network
industry. Well, be careful what you wish for (as the proverb
goes) because you may get it. 

The FCC, under Chairman Michael Powell, is said to be ready to
move by as early as next month on a couple of important fronts.
These include:

-Changes to the rules that force incumbent telephone companies to
open their networks to competitors. Chairman Powell has made
clear that he wants competitors to build their own networks and
he seems ready to take away resale facilities as a way to enter
the local market. That would be a big victory for the RBOCs and
a big problem for the remaining competitive local exchange
carriers and AT&T and WorldCom.

-Changes to the media ownership rules that would break down long-
standing barriers to the number of TV and radio stations one
company can own, as well as barriers to companies owning
newspapers and TV stations in the same community.

I'm not going to address the second issue this week.

But the first issue causes me great fear and trepidation, and I
really want your input on this. I really want to know whether
this group of network leaders believes that such a change will
lead to a positive outcome for our industry.

The theory behind the FCC's likely move is that the RBOCs today
have no incentive to invest in facilities because they'll just
have to turn around and make them available to competitors at
below cost. That, we're told, has slowed the broadband
revolution, among other things. Once freed from these resale
constraints, the RBOCs will just bust out of the gate to
innovate and their investments will spur new growth in the
industry.

I find it hard to believe. To my mind, we are risking the future
of the fledgling competition that has developed in the local
loop for the promise of RBOC innovation and investment. RBOCs
have already gotten (very nearly across the U.S.) the long-
distance rights that the '96 Telecom Act offered up, while
competitors have had to scratch and claw to make inroads against
them. RBOCs, who understood DSL technology for years and years,
only started to deploy it in earnest during the first beautiful,
if ill-fated, wave of competition after the '96 Act.

The unshackle-the-RBOCs theory seems to be rooted more in hope 
than in quantifiable data that shows a benefit to consumers or 
network suppliers. At least I've struggled to find that data.

Do you know of any research that shows the FCC plan will provide
the promised results? Do you personally believe it will? Is this
the right move or a fool's errand? Will changing the resale
rules save networking? Or kill competition? Or both? (Can that
be?) Let me know what you think.

Drop me a note at mailto:jgallant@vortex.net and I'll share the
thoughts next week. 

Thanks. We'll go into more depth, with some insiders' thoughts on
these issues, in future Digests.
