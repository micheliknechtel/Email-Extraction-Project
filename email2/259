<-> Search Engine Optimization Techniques: Playing Conservatively

Eric Lander at Search Engine Guide 2003-01-07
http://www.searchengineguide.com/lander/2003/0107_el1.html

When a webmaster or amateur SEO takes on a sites optimization and search 
engine marketing plan - they often does so without the proper knowledge of 
what works and what does not work. As a result, sites can become penalized, 
banned, or worse yet - the optimization itself simply never grows into the 
potential it once had.



<-> Funny Things Afoot in Google!

Search Engine Optimization Support Forums 2003-01-07

If there's one really important skill in SEO, it's  "keeping an open mind". 
It's an industry that forces us to hypothesise and theorise, but we need to 
be careful not to get caught in one track of thought. Events today brought 
that concept back to the forefront of my mind.

"I don't think we need to go around looking for things for which there is 
no evidence that they exist at all. I do think we need to look closely at 
what does happen though, e.g. SK, to try to determine what's right and wrong. "

"If Overture shows only the three top paid listings at other search 
engines, and if you are unable to compete with the top three bids, is there 
any value in spending limited funds in the first place?"
