Subject: Re: [Mercedes] W-124 Door Checks

Gary, I have tried repairing/lubricating 201/124 door checks and only
succeded in making them work reliably again ONCE. I used LOTS of
AreoKroil on that one occasion and that has been the only lubricant that
ever resulted in an improvement that lasted more that a day or two. Now,
more than a year later that check is starting to get noisy again. The
use of AreoKroil seems almost counterintuitive (it's a very "thin"
penetrating oil used to loosen "frozen" nuts/bolts), but IT worked and
NOTHING else ever has worked! I expect that application of oil/grease to
a check that has been removed from the door SHOULD do a better job. If
you have a check failing in only a few years, that suggests that LOTS of
water/sluch/salt is getting inside the door. That should be addressed.

New door checks cost less the $20.

Subject: Re: [Mercedes] OE W114 tires?

I found an interesting (and hopefully accurate) conversion chart on Cooper tires.  I'm guessing that they'll hold true for Michellin's also.

http://www.tirexusa.com/cooper/sportmas.html

So, according to this chart, 185R14 would be roughly equivalent (in terms of load, width, etc...) to a 185/70R14

What do other people with W114's run?  Again, like I said before, the previous owner of my 1975 280 (114.060) has 195/70 R14's and they tend to scrape when turning.

Thanks a bunch,
Warren

The original 175x14 or 6.95x14 tires are probably most close to an 80
aspect ratio tire (someone once told me they actually had an 83 aspect
ratio, but I've never confirmed that). A 185/75x14 will be very close as
will the original 175S14. Yokohama makes a 185/75x14 Avid Touring tire
with an 80kmi warranty and a $40 price tag.

Hi Alec,

That's the official tire company term for the sizes.  I assume it
dates from the early days or radials.  Back then, US tires were sort
of Whitworth sized, measured in decimal fractions of inches, i.e.
770x14s rather than 185x14s.  Radial tires came in as 185Rx14s.
Probably because everything from 'over there' was metric,
the name stuck.

We're still only part of the way to real metric sized tires.  The
hole in the center is still 14, not 35.  Also, rims are still measured
in Whitworth sizes, like 14 x 5.5 for a '75 280.

Sam

OK, Sam. I'll bite. ;-)

What the heck do you mean? I also would have said that pretty much all tires
are metric now. I remember putting GR60-14's on my 72 Cutlass Supreme when I
was a kid and figuring out that they were about 235/60 in metric-ese. Nobody
uses just letters anymore for tire size, just for speed ratings.

I thought metric tires were the ones that fit a rim of
360mm or 395mm such as the tires on a Citroen or
Mustangs with the oddball TRX suspension package.

Subject: Re: [Mercedes] glow plug circuit

Glow plugs decay and fail just as any resistor (an incandescent light
bulb is a good example) fails after some number of thermal cycles. So a
plug may last for many thousands of starting cycles, but WILL eventually
fail. In 61x series diesels using parallel plugs, 150-250kmi lifetimes
are common for the original Bosch or Beru plugs (newer diesels with
"afterstart" glow plug function seem to deliver about 25% of that
lifetime, presumably because the plugs are on MUCH longer for every cold
start). Most non-OEM replacements that I know of are substantially
inferior to the Bosch or Beru replacments and can fail within a few
months or just a few years. The OEM plugs cost about $10 each from many
distributors (I know that Rusty has them in that range). 

Plugs should be torqued to 20 Nm (15 ft-lb) and you can use a dab of
anti-sieze on the plug (but it is seldom necessary). If the plug is
shrouded in carbon inside the prechamber, the plug will not work
optimally and will fail prematurely. My rule of thumb is that if the old
plug must be wiggle and yanked to be removed, then the prechamber area
needs to be reamed with a glow plug reamer. In the absence of a proper
reamer, I know of people using a dowel or an old plug with the heating
element flatened to "ream" out the prechamber and they claim they work
fine. On the only occasion that I needed a reamer and didn't have one, I
pulled the injector and cleaned the prechamber from above and the blew
it out by cranking the engine over a few times with the injector (or
glow plug) out and the injection pump shutoff held down. That worked FOR
ME.

Subject: [Mercedes] OM603 - strange results from glow plug test

I found a dead glow plug in the SDL but the process of
finding it raises some questions.

I tested the resistance to ground of each pin at the
relay.  #1, #2, #5 and #6 showed 1.7 ohms, #4 showed
6.6 ohms (dead), and #3 showed 1.500 ohms.

Question 1 - I'm using a very basic Radio Shack DVM. 
Why does it read 01.7 for the 4 good plugs, 06.6 for
the bad plug and 1.500 consistently for #3?  Why does
it change the display format for only that plug?  I
was thinking it's part of the auto scaling function,
but the 1.7 ohm readings fluctuate between 1.6 and 1.8
staying most of the time at 1.7.  I figure it there's
scaling, that's where it would give me more digits.

I also tested the resistance to ground of the plug
terminals.  #1 showed 1.7 ohms, I couldn't get my
probe on #2, #3 showed 1.500 ohms, #4 showed 6.6 ohms,
#5 showed 2.0 ohms and #6 showed 1.3 ohms.  The
connector was off the relay.

Question 2 - If I put my probes together, I get 1.4
ohms.  How could I get 1.3 ohms through the #6 plug?

I'm using the cheapest DVM I could find so I shouldn't
be surprised at questionable results.  I'd like to
understand why the results aren't random.  Each test
yields the same results everytime I try.

Yes, I'm getting a new set of plugs.

Thanks,

After Sam's reply, I was just about to see who else remembered the TRX
stuff.

Michelin is at it again, with 540 and 560 diameters (roughly 21.25 and 22
inches), with the PAX system. The new BMW Rolls Royce Phantom uses
265x790R540A tires. Also some Mazda, Renault, and Toyota concept vehicles at
this weeks US auto shows with 225x750R540A, 225x690R540A, 240x800R560A, and
215x730R560 tire sizes.

I vaguely remember the TRX coming in just two sizes. I wonder what
replacement rubber is still available to fit those wheels? Probably
unimportant, since it was a coupla Ford products using them, and all those
cars would have fallen completely apart by now.

Leave it to those French to think they can come up with a better tire and
wheel "system" by using something other than plain inches. ;-)

Hi all. My head gasket is seeping, or I have a crack. I'm still trying
to find out whether I need to remove the head and replace the gasket,
leaving the valves alone or just use some aluminum/copper seal stuff to
fix it. I'm starting to lean towards the seal in a can stuff, is this a

Subject: Re: [Mercedes] OE W114 tires OE size (I measured)
Date: Mon, 6 Jan 2003 14:57:07 -0500

I disagree.  I just so happen to have an original set of wheels/tires (yes,
they are the original tires, never replaced) in that back of my shop.  I
just took a few measurements and came up with the following.  175 as we all
hopefully know is the width of the tire at its widest point in millimeters.
The next number you normally see is the aspect ratio, which is a percentage
of height versus width, which is missing from the original tires and then
the rim diameter being the last measurement.  The measurement that I just
came up with was 130 mm in sidewall height, measured from the tallest part
of the tire all the way down to the bottom of the bead.  If you do that
math, you will see that the OE sized tire is actually almost a 75 series
tire. (a little more than 74 percent as high as wide)  Therefore, without
hesitation I state as fact that the OE tire size on that car would be a
175/75/14.  Keep in mind that the wider you go regardless of whether or not
the aspect ratio stays the same percentage, the tire is getting taller.  I
personally use (on one of my 1975 model 240D's)a 185/70/14 without any
rubbing or problems.
Good luck!

Evidently, numerous auto manufacturers, including Daimler and Audi, employ 
folks who sniff cars. Yes, they are paid salaries to sniff new cars.

The scoop is that volatile organic compounds (VOC) flashing off in newly 
manufactured automobiles is increasingly becoming a health concern in 
Europe and Japan, enough of a concern to justify car smelling positions.

Ouch.

I just checked Tire Rack for an 85 635.
They list 220/55VR390 TRX tires brand new for $207!

I guess that's justification for changing to more common wheel sizes.

That's also the only size they show for TRX.

greetings ...

thanks to all who gave advice re: the testing and replacement of the
glow-plugs for the '82 300D turbo .. yes, i can see that it will be
difficult to use any kind of torque measuring device given the location of
the plugs ...
the haynes manual does not say anything about reaming the pre-chambers, but
i have followed the advice of the list, and found a suitable tool to remove
the carbon ... it seems logical that this will help prolong the life of the
plug ...
thanks again ...

There's an onramp near where I work where there are two lanes leading past
a set of metering lights.  The lanes then merge into a single onramp.

The other night, after the metering lights were off, a fellow in a pickup
truck saw fit to pass me in the left metering lane, because he didn't like
the slow speed with which I had approached the beginning of the onramp.  
(The road approaching the ramp is full of ruts.)  Of course, I was
beginning to accelerate to 60 to merge onto the highway

Immediately after he pulled ahead of me in the left metering lane, he
momentarily jammed the parking brake (sparks flying from under the truck)  
to slide the rear end sideways into my front bumper.

Lucky for him I left my weapons at home.
