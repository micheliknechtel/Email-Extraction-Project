An Angel Changed my Life
 
Hi,

My story is something that happened a few years ago that 
changed my life in so many ways.  My husband and I were 
separated and I had been to see him. We were talking about a 
reconciliation.  It was late when I started back home, and I 
was in terrible condition. I was drinking!  About half way 
home, I passed out under the wheel of my car. I woke up and 
my car was flipping over and over on the main highway.  I was 
screaming to God to please let me live so I could be with my 
kids. When I came to a stop, I had to crawl out of my back 
window.  Every window was busted, the bucket seats were laying 
flat, and my car was just about mashed flat.  I only had one 
bruise on my leg, and one small cut.  The thing is, I wasn't 
wearing a seat belt! The only thing I know is there was someone 
looking after me.  Was it my angel?  Since then, I have 
stopped drinking, and my husband and I got back together that
night.  I'm lucky to be alive.

Thanks,
Carla
