Life Extension Weekly Update Exclusive
JAMA study shows years lost to obesity

For those who have failed to heed recent warnings concerning the life end=
angering effects of obesity, a study in the January 8 2003 issue of the J=
ournal of the American Medical Association calculated the number of years=
 of life an individual can expect to lose if they fail to control the con=
dition.  The researchers analyzed data from US Life tables, the third Nat=
ional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the First National Hea=
lth and Nutrition Epidemiologic Follow-up study and NHANESII Mortality St=
udy, which provided information on body mass index and mortality for part=
icipants ages 18 to 85. =20

The researchers found strong differences associated with race and gender =
in years of life lost to obesity.  The body mass index associated with th=
e greatest longevity was determined to be 23 - 25 for Caucasians and 23 -=
 30 for African-Americans.  Younger adults who were overweight faced more=
 years lost than older overweight adults.  Severe obesity in white men ag=
es 20 to 30 predicted  a maximum of thirteen years of life lost, or a 17 =
percent reduction in life expectancy.  Severely overweight white women fr=
om the same age group had a loss of eight years of life.  While older bla=
ck men and women who were moderately obese did not appear to have a reduc=
tion in lifespan, severe obesity in young black men predicted a maximum o=
f a twenty year reduction in lifespan.

The authors remark that years of life lost is only one consequence of obe=
sity, and that impairment of quality of life may be more significant beca=
use of its effect on day to day living. =20

Protocol:  Obesity

Being overweight and obese are underlying risk factors for the top causes=
 of death, including hypertension, adult-onset diabetes, heart disease, c=
ancer, and stroke. Obesity is a major cause of the overall loss of energy=
 experienced by so many people.

According to the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Surgeon Gener=
al, most of "the top ten causes of death due to disease are attributable =
to health risks associated with excess body fat." The National Institutes=
 of Health states it flatly: "Obesity is a leading cause of heart disease=
, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, and even cancer."

Insulin resistance prevents serum glucose from entering cells. If glucose=
 cannot get into the cells to produce energy, it will be stored in the bo=
dy as fat. Chromium and magnesium have been shown to help break down cell=
ular insulin resistance. For chromium to be effective in the body, it nee=
ds to have niacin present. Many health-conscious people receive supplemen=
tal niacin with their B complex formula, but Life Extension's chromium su=
pplement contains 30 mg of niacin in addition to 200 mcg of chromium in e=
ach capsule. This small amount of niacin does not usually produce a niaci=
n "flush," but does ensure that niacin will be available to work with chr=
omium to reduce serum glucose levels by breaking down insulin resistance.=


The published studies actually show that magnesium is more effective than=
 chromium in breaking down insulin resistance.  Magnesium deficiency is a=
nother cause of excess weight gain in Americans. Chromium can lower chole=
sterol levels as well as serum glucose levels. Magnesium can protect agai=
nst heart attacks and stroke. Taking these supplements to help lose weigh=
t may provide significant life extension benefits in addition to weight l=
oss.

Featured Products of the Week
Magnesium citrate capsules

A review of assimilation studies suggests that the citrate salt of magnes=
ium is the best absorbed into the bloodstream. The major downside of usin=
g magnesium citrate, however, is that it is only 16% magnesium. And the r=
ecommended intake of elemental magnesium to maintain vascular health is b=
etween 300 to 800 mg a day.

The Life Extension Buyers Club offers a magnesium supplement that provide=
s 160 mg of elemental magnesium in each 1000 mg capsule of magnesium citr=
ate. This gives you the citrate salt's high absorb-ability while providin=
g adequate amounts of elemental magnesium.

Super CLA with Guarana

Since 1996 when LEF introduced CLA to its members, researchers have disco=
vered even more positive health effects of this nutrient. One such discov=
ery is CLA's anti-obesity effect.  Studies show that CLA can be used as a=
n excellent tool for weight management because of its capability to reduc=
e body fat and at the same time maintain lean muscle mass. Studies where =
mice were fed 3000 to 4000 mg of CLA a day showed a reduction in body fat=
 of 60% and an increase in lean body mass. Other animal studies demonstra=
ted similar or better results=97up to 88% body fat loss in just six weeks=
.

More recent studies have revealed even more exciting news about CLA's ant=
iobesity effects. It seems CLA can reduce the volume of adipocytes, or fa=
t cells, in the body. In a particular study, mice were given CLA or CLA p=
lus guarana, a herb that contains a form of caffeine called guaranine tha=
t is 2.5 times stronger than the caffeine found in coffee and other drink=
s. In just 6 weeks, there was significant reduction in fat mass in both g=
roups. However, the group of mice that were fed the combination CLA/guara=
na lost fat because the size and number of adipocytes decreased, while th=
e CLA only group lost fat due to a reduction in fat cell size alone (FASE=
B Journal, v. 16, no. 5, pt. I; March 22, 2002).

Questions and Answers

Q I am a type II diabetic and need to lose weight. Would CLA help and can=
 I take it considering that I am a diabetic?

A  CLA supplementation has been shown to improve the lean mass to body fa=
t ratio, decreasing fat deposition, especially in the abdomen and enhanci=
ng muscle growth. One mechanism by which CLA reduces body fat is to preve=
nt the excess accumulation of glucose and fatty acids in the body's adipo=
cytes (fat cells). People become fatter when the volume of their adipocyt=
es expands. CLA also facilitates fat loss by improving insulin sensitivit=
y and increasing energy expenditure. This means it can be helpful not onl=
y for weight loss but for diabetes too. The University of Wisconsin relea=
sed results of a six-month study involving 89 overweight people. Individu=
als who supplemented with CLA were better able to lose weight and maintai=
n goal weight, with less fat regained and more muscle mass retained.

In reference to diabetes, CLA may have advantages over current drug thera=
pies considering overall health benefits. Animal studies at Purdue showed=
 that when Zucker diabetic fatty rats (those specially bred to become obe=
se and develop glucose intolerance) were given the drug, TZD, they got fa=
tter. Conversely, when laboratory animals were given CLA they became lean=
er. Also, during the course of the CLA study, obese animals lost 10% of b=
ody fat. After two weeks, CLA-supplemented rats were diabetes free; all o=
f the unsupplemented rats had developed diabetes.
