// -- MODERATOR COMMENT -- //

Happy New Year I-Developers,

I hope the festive season has provided the opportunity for you all
to energize the batteries in readiness for the year of coding ahead
:)

2002 zipped by so quickly that I think it did little more than set
the stage for some interesting issues that should generate some fun
in 2003.  One area in particular is the Web Application User
Interface development environment, where Flash MX, SVG, XForms, XUL
and Curl (as technologies) are all positioning themselves for a
share of the action.  An interesting observation is that Microsoft
has not yet shown it's hand...Will MS purchase Macromedia and
promote Flash as the rumours suggest?

Another big, albeit ongoing, issue for this year will be in the Web
Service arena. Perhaps we will see the emergence of useful
applications built on the WSDL, SOAP and UDDI architecture.

What issues do you think will be big in 2003?

>>

To kick this year's discussion off, I can't think of a better post
than the one sent by former moderator Rajesh Chawla.  Rajesh asks
the group to share its web service and SOAP experience.

Happy coding,
Peter Schonefeld

==>TOPIC: WEB SERVICES WITH SOAP

From: Rajesh Chawla <rc@trcs.com>

Hi folks,

I'm getting more and more into SOAP. It provides me with the ability
to expose proprietary code in a relatively painless fashion using an
XML standard that has the potential of working through a firewall.

I'm very curious to hear if other folks are using SOAP or am I out
on a limb again :-)

Regards,
Rajesh

SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol and relates to the
passing of messages between web service applications (remote
procedure calls).  It seems that SOAP is the dominant message
protocol to emerge from several alternatives as it has been adopted
by industry in the form of a W3C recommendation.

A good reference for reading about SOAP is the W3C's Primer:
