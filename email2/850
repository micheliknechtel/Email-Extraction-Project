Pentium 4 Mobile Speed Bump

Imagine you take your brand-new Pentium 4 laptop, run a few
benchmarking programs and discover that your processor and bus speeds
are much lower than you expected, not to mention paid for.

Before you launch into a tirade, learn why this behavior is not
unexpected, nor is it a flaw, in mobile processors.

E.G. for Example: Your Next PC? You Won't Recognize It
By Eric Grevstad
Pundits (including HwC's editor) have pontificated about notebooks
replacing desktop PCs, but while sales trends point that way, they're
not moving that quickly. That's given desktops time to strike back --
and what's the trend that ties the newest corporate office systems,
Shuttle's high-performance cubes, and Sony's Vaio W coffee-table
conversation piece? Let's get small.

Weekly Platform Trends: SiS' 655 Joins the Dual-DDR Party
By Vince Freeman
Dual-channel DDR is the must-have memory-controller design among
performance PC chipsets, so SiS' newest Pentium 4 platform boasts dual
DDR333 support. But has Intel's move to Hyper-Threading and, soon, an
800MHz system bus spoiled SiS' product planning?

Canon i550 Color Bubble Jet Printer Review
By Eric Grevstad
It's easy to find a good inkjet printer for $150 -- but with
outstanding speed and borderless-photo output, jam- or idiot-proof
paper feeding, and four-color ink cartridges that are just half the
cost of some competitors' cartridges, we think we've found a great
one.

Weekly CPU Prices
As with our last few editions, the big news revolves around the upper-
end of the Pentium 4 scale, with the Pentium 4-2.6 GHz and 3.06 GHz HT
processors receiving healthy price cuts. Other than that, it's a
pretty standard week for processors. There are still some prime buying
opportunities, so don't miss the detailed price data and commentary
found in our CPU Pricing Guide.

Weekly Memory Prices
There continues to be very different trends in the memory market, with
SDRAM rising quite noticeably, while most DDR modules experienced
slow, though still downward movement. So for most buyers, it's good
news as we continue to see lower prices for 512-MB modules, and even
high-end PC3200 is dropping quite steadily. It's another good week for
DDR purchases, so don't miss the detailed price list and commentary
found in our Weekly Memory Pricing Guide.
