**************** BIZARRE STORY OF THE WEEK ***************** 

--------------- Drunk Driving For Beginners ----------------

AUSTRALIA - The smart thing to do if you've had a little 
too much to drink is find yourself a designated driver to 
make sure you get home safely. The not-so-smart thing to do 
is to make that designated driver your five-year-old son. A 
37-year-old drunken mother had her youngest son man the wheel 
while she operated the pedals. The result was a devastating 
crash that injured the mother and her two sons when the car 
hit a tree, hurtled down an embankment and threw all three 
passengers from the car. The mother's condition was the most 
severe with back and neck injuries and facial lacerations. 
Her youngest son suffered a broken hand and the other sus-
tained only minor injuries. No further brain damage was 
reported on the woman.

LAFF A DAY: 

A man went to the doctor complaining of insomnia. The doctor
gave him a thorough examination, found absolutely nothing 
physically wrong with him, and then told him, "Listen, if 
you ever expect to cure your insomnia, you just have to 
stop taking your trouble to bed with you." 

"I know" said the man, "but I can't. My wife refuses to 
sleep alone."

CLEAN LAFFS: 

I went with my daughter to visit a prestigious university. 
Our student guide pointed out the nationally ranked library 
and state-of-the-art science facilities. She told us that 
the professors were the best in the country, and she re-
commended my daughter apply early to improve her chances 
for admission. "We get so many applicants," she boasted, 
"because of the stature of the school."

After the tour I asked our guide, "So, why did you choose 
this school?"

"Oh," she replied matter-of-factly, "my boyfriend goes here."
