                                          <span class="ParaHeader3">Welcome to INNOVATION FYI</span> <br>
         <span class="docbodytext"> The objectives of FYI are to share with
 you the        answers to common questions that users ask, to bring you
up-to-date  on our        products' latest capabilities, to differentiate
our products'  capabilities        versus the competition and to provide
you with hints and recommendations.        <br>
         <br>
         <strong>FOCUS ON:</strong> <br>
         <br>
         <span class="ParaHeader3">S/390 Linux and OS/390 UNIX</span> <br>
         FDR full-volume high-speed backups may be used to back up S/390
Linux  volumes        in CDL (compatible) format, but only full-volume recoveries
 are possible        from these backups. You cannot restore individual Linux
 files from full-volume        backups. Since Linux uses 'lazy writes', you
 must 'harden' the Linux data        to disk before dumping it with FDR by
 unmounting the Linux file system or        shutting down Linux. <br>
         <br>
         VM volumes containing Linux minidisks can also be backed up with
FDR. Although        it is possible to restore individual Linux minidisks,
you still cannot restore        individual Linux files from these backups.
      <br>
         <br>
         FDR full-volume backups and FDRDSF data set backups may be used
for  high-speed        backups of the HFS and zFS data sets used by OS/390
UNIX  System Services        (USS). You can restore entire individual HFS
and zFS  data sets from these        backups but you cannot restore individual
USS  files from these backups.        When backing up HFS data sets, you
should  also 'harden' the data by unmounting        the file systems or using
the  FDR parameter HFS=QUIESCE to quiesce the file        systems during
backup.        <br>
         <br>
         So, these FDR backups can be used for high-speed restores for disaster
 recovery,        and for local recovery of entire volumes, or file systems,
 but they are        not appropriate for recovery of individual files which
 have become lost        or corrupted. <br>
         <br>
         Innovation offers FDR/UPSTREAM for S/390 Linux and OS/390 UNIX to
 address        this need. FDR/UPSTREAM can back up Linux S/390 and OS/390
 UNIX files to        OS/390 mainframe disk or tape without requiring an
unmount  or shut down.        FDR/UPSTREAM can restore individual files or
groups of files on command.        <br>
         <br>
         One of the key NEW features of FDR/UPSTREAM S/390 Linux is: <br>
         <br>
         <span class="ParaHeader3">UPSTREAM S/390 Linux Rescuer</span> <br>
         A powerful and unique addition to the FDR/UPSTREAM S/390 Linux support
 is        the S/390 Linux Rescuer, the industry's first and only complete
 backup and        restore solution with disaster recovery for S/390 Linux.
 The S/390 Linux        Rescuer is a stand alone system recovery facility
for SuSE S/390 Linux systems.        <br>
         <br>
         The S/390 Linux Rescuer allows administrators to completely restore
 a system        from data that is saved in FDR/UPSTREAM without separate
system backups.        S/390 Linux Rescuer is completely integrated into
FDR/UPSTREAM.       <br>
         <br>
         <strong>In addition to the S/390 Linux Rescuer, UPSTREAM provides:</strong>
        <br>

      <ul class="ulist">
        <li>Logical file backup for network attached Linux on the Desktop,
 Linux            on Intel Servers as well as Linux for S/390.</li>

         <span class="ParaHeader3">NEW Features for FDR V5.4 L20 LARGE DISK
 SUPPORT</span>        <br>
         All FDR programs have been updated to support 'large disks' (up
to  32760        cylinders in size). Most reports will identify disks larger
than a 3390-9        as a '3390-27' (for 27GB capacity). <br>
         <br>
         The FASTCPK recovery log has been enhanced to handle a larger number
 of        relocated tracks, enabling it to support large disks and 3390-9
 disks without        special processing or multiple executions. <br>
         <br>
         In FDREPORT, 'ENABLE=LARGEDISK' is required to support devices larger
 than        a 3390-9. <br>
         <br>
         <span class="ParaHeader3">FDREPORT</span> <br>

      <ul class="ulist">
        <li>FDREPORT can now access and report on offline disk volumes. Offline
           volumes may be used with point-in-time backups (such as FDRINSTANT)
           or with other special volume replication functions (PPRC, SRDF,
BCVs,            ShadowImage, FlashCopy, SnapShot, etc). </li>
        <li>The new option FASTPATH (ENABLE=FASTPATH) significantly reduces
 the            overhead of allocating and opening disk volumes, improving
 FDREPORT            efficiency when processing large numbers of disk volumes.
 FASTPATH can            reduce FDREPORT execution time from 25% to 75% when
 processing many            disk volumes, depending on the type of report
you have requested. FASTPATH            is required when reporting on offline
 volumes. </li>
      </ul>
         <br>
         <span class="ParaHeader3">MULTI-VOLUME VSAM RESTORE</span> <br>
         FDRDSF, FDRCOPY and FDRABR have been enhanced when restoring or
copying         multi-volume VSAM clusters. FDR will now continue searching
the available         output volumes (NVOL=) for a volume with sufficient
space to allocate  each        piece of the cluster, for SMS as well as non-SMS.
As long as volumes are        available in the NVOL list or SMS storage group
with sufficient  free space        (and size) to handle the extents of the
cluster, the restore/copy  will be        successful. <br>
         <br>
         <span class="ParaHeader3">ARCHIVE CONTROL FILE SIZE</span> <br>
         The Archive Control File (ACF) can now contain records for up to
5,701,632        data sets or VSAM components. <br>
         <br>
         <span class="ParaHeader3">FDRREORG</span> <br>
         FDRREORG has been updated to handle all currently supported types
 of IAM        and VSAM data sets. The CONVERTINDEX operand can be used to
 convert VSAM        files which were originally allocated with IMBED or
REPLICATE  to NOIMBED        and NOREPLICATE, since IBM no longer recommends
those options.        <br>
         <br>
         <span class="ParaHeader3">EMC CONCURRENT BCV SUPPORT</span> <br>
         FDRINSTANT for EMC now supports Concurrent BCVs, a new feature in
 TimeFinder        which allows 2 BCVs to be connected to the same standard
 volume at once.        FDRINSTANT can SPLIT and RE-ESTABLISH either BCV.
      <br>
         <br>
         FDRINSTANT now uses EMC Instant Split as a default. FDRINSTANT customers
        running V5.4 Level 20, 21 or 22 should request zap P-54.2034 to improve
        the performance of Instant Split. Zap is automatically applied on
V5.4 L23        or higher. <br>
         <br>
         <span class="ParaHeader3">E-MAIL NOTIFICATION</span> <br>
         You have the option of sending e-mail messages when an FDR, FDRDSF,
 FDRCOPY        or FDRABR operation is unsuccessful (and if you like, for
successful operations        as well). An optional FDREMAIL DD statement
in an FDR step will invoke the        facility; it points to control statements
defining the message and its recipients.        A mail server that supports
SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) is required.        Messages can also
be sent to alphanumeric pagers and cell phones. <br>

      <ul class="ulist">
        <li>UPSTREAM/SOS local backup volumes supports bi-directional operations
            for backups AND restores and for file transfer operations, providing
            the high-speed data transfer and reduced network overhead of
UPSTREAM/SOS.           </li>
        <li>UPSTREAM features logical file level support for S/390 Linux
 as well            as new non-disruptive online database agents for Oracle

         <span class="CellTextHeader"><strong>FDREPORT</strong></span> <br>
         <br>
         <span class="ParaHeader3">How can I produce a report with just one
 line        for each multi-volume data set or cluster?</span> <br>
         In FDREPORT V5.4, it is possible to obtain a report that contains
 only one        line per data set, even if the data set extends across multiple
 volumes        and/or is a VSAM cluster with multiple components. Fields
that are additive,        such as extents, bytes, and tracks, will show the
total for all parts of        the component, cluster, or non-VSAM data set.
Percentages will be calculated        based on these totals. Other fields,
such as record length and key position,        will be taken from the first
volume. In a report line for a cluster, fields        that are not totaled
will be taken from the data component. <br>
         <br>
         This new feature is called RECORDSUMMARY, because each record (report
 line)        may be a summary of multiple volumes and/or components. This
 is different        from the summaries controlled by the SUMMARY command
and the SUM= operand,        which are produced at control breaks between
sets of report lines. RECORDSUMMARY        can be requested if you are processing
 with any of these three data types:        CATARCH, CATVTOC, or EXTRACT.
The RECORDSUMMARY operand is valid on either        the DEFAULT or the PRINT
command. There are two values for RECORDSUMMARY:        RECORDSUMMARY=CLUSTER
specifies that each report line will represent a VSAM        cluster or non-VSAM
data set, and RECORDSUMMARY= COMPONENT specifies that        each report
line will reflect a VSAM component or non-VSAM data set. <br>
         <br>
         For this feature to work, the input must be sorted by cluster and
 data set        name. The output from CATARCH and CATVTOC is always sorted
 in this sequence;        when running with DATATYPE of EXTRACT, you may
need  to provide the appropriate        SORT command. Note: The BREAK option
of  the SORT command will not be honored        when RECORDSUMMARY is in
effect.  It is possible, however, to use the SUM=YES        operand or the
SUMMARY  command to obtain final totals and to control their        format.

         <span class="ParaHeader3">How does FDRPAS handle multi-volume data
 sets?</span>        <br>
         <span class="docbodytext">FDRPAS is not sensitive to multi-volume
 data sets. Since FDRPAS swaps one        volume at a time, to a like device,
 in a manner that is transparent to the        system and applications, it
 can swap volumes containing pieces of multi-volume        data sets with
no special considerations. Applications will be unaware that        part
of the data set has been moved to a new device and part may still be
   on an older device. <br>
         <br>
         <span class="ParaHeader3">How does FDRPAS handle HFS and zFS data
 sets?</span>        <br>
         <span class="docbodytext">HFS (Hierarchical File System) data sets
 are used with z/OS UNIX System        Services (USS), the UNIX component
of z/OS and OS/390. FDRPAS is not sensitive        to HFS data sets. Volumes
 containing HFS data sets can be swapped even when        they are in use.
       <br>
         <br>
         Likewise, zFS data sets are a new format used by USS, based on a
VSAM linear        cluster. Volumes containing zFS data sets can also be swapped
without problems        or any special considerations. <br>
         <br>
        </span>       <span class="ParaHeader3">What FDR &amp; ABR RESTORE
 parameters are recommended        at a disaster recovery site?</span> <br>
         SMSPROT=NONE and CONFMESS=NO are strongly recommended. <br>
         <br>
         By default, FDR and ABR full-volume restore requires confirmation
 from the        operator, to prevent accidental overlay of a volume. But
at a disaster site,        where hundreds or thousands of volumes must be
restored, this confirmation        is useless. CONFMESS=NO will suppress
it and speed up the restores. <br>
         <br>
         Likewise, backups of SMS volumes can normally only be restored to
 SMS-managed        volumes. But at a DR site, you are probably restoring
under a starter system        where the target volumes are not marked as
SMS. SMSPROT=NONE allows the        SMS volumes to be restored. The SMS volumes
will have the correct SMS attributes        when the full system is IPLed.
      <br>
         <br>
         <span style="font-size: 11px;"> Note: ABR users who license FDRDRP
 can significantly        reduce elapsed time when recovering from incremental
 backups on high capacity        tape. </span> <br>
         <br>
         <span class="ParaHeader3">How can I improve the performance of FDRINSTANT
        for ABR (the SPLIT, PSPLIT, SNAP, or FCOPY step)?</span> <br>
         The number of //TAPEx DD DUMMY statements controls how many FDRINSTANT
 subtasks        execute concurrently; each subtask processes one disk volume
 at a time.        To increase the number of volumes that are processed concurrently,
 add more        //TAPEx DD DUMMY statements (and TAPExx DDs if needed to
specify retentions).        Up to 9 TAPEx DDs are supported. The number of
TAPEx DDs in the SPLIT/PSPLIT/SNAP/FCOPY        step can be more than are
used in the actual DUMP step. <br>
         <br>
         If you run several ABR jobs in parallel, each with a number of TAPEx
 DDs,        you can usually process hundreds of volumes in just a few minutes.
       <br>
         <br>
         <span class="ParaHeader3">How can I release an FDRINSTANT copy?</span>
       <br>
         Sometimes you want to backup an FDRINSTANT point-in-time copy with
 PGM=FDR        or FDRDSF, but you don't want to release the copy immediately,
 perhaps because        you want to use it for another purpose. To do so,
you omit the REL or RET        subparameter of BCV=, FCOPY=, SNAP= or PPRC=,
e.g., code SNAP=USE instead        of SNAP=(USE,REL). <br>
         <br>
         To release the point-in-time copy, use a simple FDRDSF step like
this:</span>
      <pre style="font-family: Courier;">//RELEASE  EXEC PGM=FDRDSF,REGION=0M
//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
//TAPE1     DD DUMMY
//DISK1     DD UNIT=SYSALLDA,
//          VOL   =SER=vvvvvv,DISP=OLD
  DUMP TYPE=DSF,DSN=VTOC,SNAP=(USE,REL)</pre>
         <span class="ParaHeader3">How can I improve FDR's backup performance?</span>
        <br>
         <span class="docbodytext">The DUMP parameter RTC=YES is strongly
recommended, especially if the disks        are attached via FICON channels.
RTC=YES:
      <ul class="ulist">
        <li>Reads and writes up to 1 cylinder of data per I/O.</li>
        <li>Moves disk buffers above the line, allowing more backups to run
concurrently            in one DUMP step. </li>
      </ul>
         </span>
      <p><span class="docbodytext">Custom zap C-54.0905 will make RTC=YES
          the default in V5.4. You can download the zap from the Innovation
 FTP          site or request it from Innovation. <br>
