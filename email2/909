** BREAST SELF-EXAM BASICS **

Performing a breast self-exam can be confusing. How 
can you tell the difference between good and bad 
lumps? How much of the breast should be examined? 
What's the best way to do it? See our illustrated 
guide on how to perform this 10-Minute Breast Health 
Checkup:

http://www.ivillagehealth.com/features/checkups/pages/0,12910,526654_529852,00.html

The best time to examine your breasts is just as your 
period is ending, when your breasts are least likely 
to be swollen and easiest to examine. If your 
menstrual cycle is irregular, or if you have stopped   
menstruating due to menopause or hysterectomy, 
perform your exam on a day of the month that is easy 
to remember. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or 
have breast implants should continue to examine their 
breasts every month. Breastfeeding mothers should 
examine their breasts after a feeding or after using 
a breast pump. Ask your doctor how hormone- or 
infertility-drug therapy might affect your breasts, 
and about the correct timing for you. 

1. EXAMINE YOURSELF STANDING UP
Stand up and place one hand behind your head. Hold 
the fingers of the other hand flat. Gently touch 
every part of the breast below the raised arm. Feel 
for lumps, bumps or thickening. Now do the other 
breast. 

2. EXAMINE YOURSELF IN FRONT OF A MIRROR  
Stand in front of a mirror. Place your hands on your 
hips. Inspect each breast for changes in size, shape 
and form. Do it again with your arms raised above 
your head.

3. EXAMINE YOURSELF LYING DOWN  
Lie back with a pillow or folded towel under your 
right shoulder. Place your right hand behind your 
head. Examine every part of your breast with the 
fingers of the left hand held flat. Feel for lumps, 
bumps or thickening. Now do the other breast. Be sure 
to follow a consistent pattern. You may want to use 
one of the following patterns:

LINES
Start in the underarm area and move your fingers 
downward little by little until they are below the 
breast. Then move your fingers slightly toward the 
middle and slowly move back up. Go up and down until 
you cover the whole area. 

WEDGES
Starting at the outer edge of the breast, move your 
fingers toward the nipple and back to the edge. Check 
your whole breast, covering one small wedge-shaped 
section at a time. Be sure to check the underarm area 
and the upper chest. 

CIRCLES
Beginning at the outer edge of your breast, move your 
fingers slowly around the whole breast in a circle. 
Move around the breast in smaller circles, gradually 
working toward the nipple. Don't forget to check the 
underarm and upper chest areas. 

Do not miss any part of the breast.


4. EXAMINE UNDER YOUR ARMS
Rest your arm on a firm surface like the top of a 
bookshelf. Examine the underarm. Feel for lumps, 
bumps or thickening in the same way. Now do the other 
underarm.
