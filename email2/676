Good Morning Groanies!

Did you know that the average brain produces enough energy 
to power a 10 watt light bulb? Now that is the average brain.

That would mean that there are brains out there that may be
able to power up to a 40 watt light bulb. I am sure only the
real smart people can do this though. 

After hearing this I got curious as to how much power my 
brain could produce so I went to the hardware store and had
a light socket installed in the back of my skull. 

It turns out I was only able to light up a single Christmas
tree bulb. Even Uncle Fester from the Addam's Family could
do better than that. 

Groaningly yours,
Sean
