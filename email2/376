==============Child Safety Tip of the Month

To accompany this month's articles...children may be more susceptible to 
health problems due to indoor air pollution. If your child is displaying 
unexplainable health symptoms, please have their health care provider 
run allergy tests and other tests to rule out indoor air pollutant 
problems. <br>
You can find an archive of all our monthly "Child Safety Tips" on our 
website!  View them here:  
http://www.stopsexoffenders.com/childsafety/monthlysafetytips.shtml

==============National Sex Offender Registry & News

View the latest news articles about online sex offender registries.  
Read the latest here: http://www.stopsexoffenders.com/registrynews.shtml 
 If you're searching for your state's sex offender registry, you'll find 
it on our National Registry (if it exists).  We include more registries 
than most websites, and are determined to find them as soon as they get 
online!  We only link to websites that provide listings directly at that 
location...we don't link to websites that merely place a link to another 
registry.  Our National Registry is listed at many police department 
websites, Television News Stations, and many other popular sites.  Visit 
our National Registry Listings to see if your state is online: 
http://www.stopsexoffenders.com/statelistings.shtml

VOLUNTEERS NEEDED:  We are always in need of Volunteers, especially 
those who help us keep the registry up-to-date and with no broken links. 
I have received a few responses - please be patient...I will eventually 
respond. I receive a few hundred emails per day - yikes! Please visit 
this page for more information on how you can help us to keep kids safe: 
http://www.stopsexoffenders.com/volunteers.shtml 

==============Official SSO Merchandise

purchasing official merchandise - you will not find them anywhere else!  
Stay tuned for new designs & products in the future! Check out the 
T-Shirts for kids, the mugs for Mom and Dad, and the informative

We want to help keep your kids safe!!  We are offering our exclusive 
printable Child ID System free to our Internet visitors!  Feel secure

As parents, we pray that our children will never be among the world's 
missing children. It's a thought we could all do without. But, if your 
child was missing, our "Child Identification System" will give 
authorities the information needed to assist in the search of your 
child.  If you are involved in a child safety organization and would 
like us to personalize our Child ID System with your logo for download 
on your website, please contact me at 
administrator@stopsexoffenders.com.  This service is free of charge.
