== Note To Self: More Lavender On The Drug Money ==
Two women accused of growing marijuana in their homes made so much money
they bought three neighboring houses so they could grow more plants.
Prosecutors contend Kathleen Jenny and Virginia Erickson were the brains
behind the $1 million pot growing operation that began in 1994 in their
basements in Spokane, Washington. The women, both 59, agreed last week
to plead guilty to money laundering and being the coolest goddamn moms
on the planet anywhere, except for maybe those moms who give their
daughters their own Hitachis when they turn 16 or the ones who still
chill with some 420 and some Thievery Corporation whilst soaking in the
hot tub and letting the well-adjusted kids use the car to go to the
rave. The business was so successful that the women eventually involved
their husbands and bought the three other neighborhood homes in which to
grow more pot. Investigators learned of their activities last summer
when a bank teller called police to say that the women's cash deposits
smelled like marijuana, because bank tellers in Spokane are just that
sneaky and uptight and in desperate need of a smack upside the head
and/or a few ounces of premium reefer theirownselves, I mean Christ,
what sort of world is it where the bank teller is sniffing your money
and calling the cops and narcing on everyone and what's next, sniffing
my deposit slips for traces of opium and illegal truffles? Back off,
Becky.

== Please Do Not Imagine The President's Puckered Lips ==
President Bush is a romantic at heart and a devoted family man, no
matter how stressful life gets at the White House, first lady Laura Bush
mumbles semi-coherently in a shockingly useless and tepid, upcoming Good
Housekeeping magazine interview that doesn't feature one mention of
Cuervo body shots or "pony rides." The heavily shellacked quasi-female
automaton with the perma-plastered smile and the negligible cultural
impact on anything anywhere says the best private time she and her
husband spend is at their ranch in Crawford, Texas, where they sit there
staring blankly out into the dust-choked plains, jaws slack,
occasionally smacking each other in the head with a two-by-four, and
reminiscing. "We like to go for rides at our ranch, before dinner," she
said, mechanically, as if tiny robotic worm-like creatures were yanking
little levers in her brain. making her talk. "He's a windshield cowboy,
as he says, which means he drives a pickup. We drive down into the
bottoms of the creekbeds and the riverbeds. And we do that nearly every
time we're there, nearly every day," she added. "Because we are
phenomenally boring and everything I do in my controlled little life is
a desperate cry for help, and/or a good ass-slap, like the kind Shrubby
used to give me when he came home late after sharing a nice 8-ball at a
Yale frat party," she did not continue, in a dazed reverie.

== Oh Dear God Please No #73 ==
The Bush family showcased what might be the next generation of its
nightmarish political dynasty Tuesday when 27-year-old George P. Bush
hosted the inauguration of his father, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The
younger Bush, who is finishing law school at the University of Texas and
who apparently isn't yet in rehab for repeat prescription med use like
his sister, hasn't said exactly what he'll be doing when he graduates,
but said he's thinking of taking the bar exam in Texas and Florida.
Either that, or taking up the new Bush family business plan of opening a
chain of strip club/laundromats/meth labs in the greater South Florida
area, hiring a bunch of skank hos and ex-cons and Enron execs and other
friends of the Bush WASP mafia, laundering money for the Carlyle Group
via offshore bank accounts in Panama or maybe Cyprus, and then
redirecting it toward GOP "campaign contributions" and generous cash
gifts to help pay for Rhenquist's diamond-studded rectal thermometer
collection and Lynne Cheney's fetish for licking sweat from the thighs
of heavily narcotized NFL linebackers and Maria Shriver. "I'm going to
DisneyWorld!" giggled the junior Shrub, when asked what he was gonna do
now that he's 27 and no longer has to share his stash with his seriously
jonesing sister.

== Oh Dear God Please No #74 ==
The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist and noted bunion on the
heel of popular culture, who has never held public office and who has
never met an exploitative sound bite he didn't love, plans to explore a
bid for the presidency in the 2004 elections, thus inducing a major
collective spasm in the Democratic party and the universe at large, and
pretty much embarrassing the already quiveringly emaciated electoral
process as a whole. "I am running for president to finally put the
issues concerning most Americans on to the front burner," Sharpton said.
"Like, you know, McDonald's cherry pie filling -- why is it so damn hot?
It burns my tongue! And Whitney Houston -- girl, eat a sammich already
and lay off the 420, right? Can I get a whole Honeybaked ham and a large
Pepsi now please? Hello?"

== That's Lavigne As In, Duh OK Whatever ==
Ground control to Avril Lavigne: It's David Bowie, like doughy -- not
Bowie, like Howie. That's how the 18-year-old Canadian singer pronounced
the veteran rock star's name when the Grammy nominations were announced
Tuesday. Lavigne was helping announce the nominees for best male rock
vocal performance at Madison Square Garden when she made the gaffe,
pronouncing Bowie's name like "Howie." When an AP reporter told her
afterward that she'd flubbed Bowie's name, Lavigne said: "Oops! I knew
that was going to happen, I knew I was going to pronounce someone's name
wrong." She was forgiven the gaffe, however, as her own last name has
proven difficult for some, who mispronounce "Lavigne" as "Annoying
overrated faux-punky sorta undereducated skater chick who is admittedly
a helluva lot cooler than Britany but who will still probably be
obsolete in year if she's not careful and by the way Iman could snap you
like a twig so show a little respect, yo, word."

In which our columnist discovers the latest in genius MP3 software, and
may never buy a new CD again
(By Mark Morford)
http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2003/01/08/notes010803.DTL&nl=fix


Oh sure there's the free downloading of music. Of course you already
know this.

Oh sure there's full-fledged software, flicks, games, porn, CDs, Iraqi
bombing stratagems, the alien code to Dick Cheney's demonic
defibrillator, all available online for downloading right now, if you
have the correct software and a righteous sense of entertainment-media
injustice and a really big hard drive and enormous amounts of free time
which of course you don't because you're not, like, a geek or something.
Right?

But of course you know about MP3 downloads. Napster. KaZaA. Yay. Song
swapping as rebellion, as pop-culture revolution, as a way to really
piss off Lars Ulrich. Then came the swift sword of dumb justice. And
Napster went poof. But KaZaA and its brethren still thrive. 

http://www.kazaa.com

As do cheapass CD burners, and DVD burners, and spindles of 100 blank
CDs for pennies apiece, all immediately followed by the increasing
realization that, Jesus with a 20GB iPod, record companies and movie
studios and etc. really have been ripping us off for, you know,
millennia. Twenty bucks for the new Coldplay CD? Only 75 cents of which
actually goes to the band? Something's got to change.

Now there is StreamRipperX for Mac. There's also equivalent software for
PCs, but I worship at the altar of Apple and the PowerBook Titanium and
hence know very little of Windows software and cringe at the bloated
bug-ridden inelegance of Microsoft so therefore I speak only of Mac. But
Windows people also know this to be very true.

http://download.com.com/3000-2182-10165388.html?tag=list

StreamRipperX is genius. StreamRipperX is the next tiny but dazzling
step in the media revolution currently terrifying AOL/Time
Warner/Disney/Viacom execs and their Range Rover dealers.

StreamRipperX is, very simply, a tiny piece of software for the Mac that
records live, continuous MP3 audio streams from Net radio stations,
automatically breaks up the songs they play into individual,
high-quality, discrete MP3 files, names them and then lets you listen,
organize, burn custom CDs, whatever. All free. 

This is all it does. It is very simple. But it is, quite simply, the
greatest thing ever in this lifetime ever. Think about it.

Here's an example of what you can do right now: Click on one of hundreds
of DJ-free, 24-hour online music stations of a particular, favorite
genre, leave StreamRipper running for a few hours (or all day) and come
back later -- and, boom, waiting for you is a couple gigs of fresh new
music, hours and hours worth, all organized by song name and group,
ready to burn right to CD. Amazing. So much for Napster.

http://www.shoutcast.com

In fact, StreamRipperX is running right now, as I type this column,
recording a live stream from Groove Salad Net radio, a downtempo/chill
station from SomaFM. The program has recorded, named and sorted a dozen
new songs just in the past eight paragraphs. And all I do is listen,
toss the songs I don't like and expand my music collection.
Effortlessly.

http://www.somafm.com/

Of course, this is all immoral and evil and short-changes the artists
involved, screws them out of royalties and rent money and pot money and
so forth, hurts the economy, causes AOL/Time Warner stock to whimper and
Steve Case to forgo buying his eighth Ferrari of the month. Right? Your
conscience says so. Something isn't quite fair about all this, it says.
Well, maybe.

Or maybe not. Maybe that's just the industry talking, guilting you into
false belief. Maybe programs like StreamRipperX, which is free and small
and elegant and effortless to use and, um, free, spreads the music
around, exposes artists to new audiences, widens the artistic purview,
cuts out the money-grubbing middleman and allows art, like information,
to be fluid and free.

Maybe such software redefines the popular culture just a little, forces
long-staid, paranoid, litigious, stagnant industries to scramble and
move and figure out new, hopefully more fair, methods by which to
support new artists and pay them to create and still make a decent
enough profit without making consumers feel like altar boys in the
Boston Archdiocese. Can I get a hell yeah?

Of course, StreamRipperX is only the most current and most brilliant
step in a very fast-moving technological evolution. It will be obsolete
within a year, replaced by something even better -- digital, insanely
fast, veritably orgiastic in its potential entertainment offerings,
on-demand everything, with the PC as the hub, and you at the helm.

But of course all that's happening now is panic. Hand-wringing.
Scowling. Lawsuits galore. Frantic CD and DVD encryption technology that
gets immediately hacked by yawning teenagers. Failing for-pay
music-downloading sites sponsored by angry record companies. How very
1996 of them.

http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2003/01/07/international0746EST0496.DTL&nl=fix

There are other ways. There are new paradigms by which money can be made
and artists can thrive and record companies can become more nimble and
smart and you can still dance naked in your living room to gobs of free
digital music pumping from your Net-connected speakers. 

Like solar power and 75-mpg cars and 5-year lightbulbs and naturopathic
medicine and gay marriage, the ideas are there, the technology is in
place, but the oppression and disinfo are rampant, as the biz is
hell-bent on keeping its angry fist wrapped around its dwindling
dollars. 

Like the movie industry (which is next on the list to face similar tech
anarchy), the record biz hasn't had to fundamentally change, well, ever.
StreamRipperX and its brethren are merely more reminders that it's about
time they did. Hell yeah.

== THE SAN FRANCISCO FACTOID ==
Essential local trivia you'll probably forget almost immediately

In 1849 a number of ships were abandoned in the marshy cove of Yerba
Buena by crews who had caught "gold fever". In response to the shortage
of building materials and the need to find accommodation for a quickly
expanding population, pontoons were built out to these ships, which were
refurbished and converted into shops, restaurants, and hotels.


---------------------------------------------------------
== THE DAILY WORD ==
It's almost like learning something

kvass \'kvas\ also kvas - noun [Russ kvas] (ca. 1553)
1) A slightly alcoholic beverage of eastern Europe made from fermented
mixed cereals and often flavored
2) Thin, weak Russian beer

Usage example: "I find if I bathe in a huge vat of vodka-infused kvass
for a couple hours then rub myself with some of the CIA's stash of
imported illegal Beluga caviar, Putin finds me irresistible and will let
me 'mount his top-secret defense initiative,' if you know what I mean,"
giggled Lynne Cheney, to her bestest friend Limpy, a dead and
taxidermied iguana.

Forget ShrubCo's lame tax-cut package that favors the rich. You want
real economic stimulus? Try Super Bowl wagering
(Associated Press)
http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2003/01/07/financial0125EST0014.DTL&nl=fix 

NEW YORK (Dow Jones/AP) -- With the holiday shopping season failing to
deliver the economic boost many Americans were looking for, hopes are
now pinned on President Bush's $674 billion stimulus package unveiled
Tuesday.

But while consumers wait on Congressional approval, there's an
alternative wave of stimulus that's set to arrive from an unofficial
source: football betting.

Some of the betting that's done during the National Football League's
playoff season occurs in more formal settings such as casinos, where
taxes will tend to be paid on the winnings. But much of the money will
be funneled "tax-free" into the hands of people who are among the most
likely to put it back into the economy.

Most of the once-a-year Super Bowl pools are held in offices, bars,
delis, fraternities, clubs, and even fire houses, and aren't counted in
official statistics. Many are already placing their bets on the outcome
of the Super Bowl on Jan. 26, weeks before they even know who's playing.

 
And it's a lot of betting: $100 billion is wagered on the Super Bowl in
both legal and illegal forms, according to Dr. Nancy Petry, an addiction
researcher at the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington,
Conn.

That's roughly 1 percent of gross domestic product. Or, stated another
way, it's about the same size as the portion of the Bush stimulus plan
that's expected to take effect this year. The big difference is, this
money will hit the economy much sooner.

"Roughly 20 percent of the addicted gamblers we see are sports bettors,
mainly young men," said Petry. That's a group known for its willingness
to spend -- just witness how much advertisers are willing to spend on a
Super Bowl slot.

The lucky ones among them might well end up playing a key role in
providing stimulus to the economy. Of course, this is expenditure that
happens every year and to that extent, it can't be seen as fresh
stimulus. But this year, the timing is especially helpful, given the
still sluggish state of the economy and the uninspiring holiday shopping
season.

The betting methods range from simple, straightforward single payoff
group wagers, to complex multiple payoff systems that attest to
considerable statistical aptitude of the wagerers.

Most of these pre-Super Bowl pools have a basic format that has nothing
to do with skill in team selection. Indeed, it's a pure numbers game.

Using a 10-by-10 grid, a wagerer selects one or more of the 100
available boxes. Only when all the boxes comprising the grid have been
filled in are numbers from one to 10 randomly assigned to each row and
column. A box with the coordinates three and three means that box wins
if the final score of the Super Bowl has the NFC and AFC teams with
scores in which the second digit (or single digit) is three. For
instance, a score of 33 to 3 or 23 to 13 would win.

Under this simplest format, with a single payoff, if the boxes sold for
$2 each, the payoff would be $200 to the winner. But bets are often much
larger, meaning that payoffs are often much larger.

All of these payouts are likely to produce a great deal of spending in
the weeks after the Super Bowl.

And then, once the Super Bowl is history, sports bettors will begin
gearing up for the National Collegiate Athletic Association's basketball
tournaments in March.
