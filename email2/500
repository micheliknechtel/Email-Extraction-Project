==> TOPIC: WHOIS RESULTS

From: John Smart <JSmart@InternetDesign.com>

I may be a bit behind current events here, but I am having a
problem. I wanted to see when my domain expired, so I did a "whois".
It didn't tell me. It told me when I registered the domain, but not
when it expires. Is this a new thing?

I cannot get a date from Tucows/Open SRS or GoDaddy. I can work out
from receipts when they will expire, but this is irritating to say
the least - plus I will be unable to warn clients who have moved
their hosting to my servers when their domains come up for renewal.
Is there a way to get the old whois information? And if not, why
not???

==> TOPIC: WHAT TO OFFER FOR .COM DOMAIN NAME

From: Frank G Fleischer <fgf@rogers.com>

I've developed a commercially successful web site (on a small scale
-- profitable because I have no overhead  and just me as staff),
using as a domain name a fairly common generic word followed by
net. (I used .net  because someone with a similar site got the .com
before I did).

Now I find that the "owner" of the .com  domain name has gone out of
business and has said he would consider selling me the right to use
the .com  domain name.

What process would you follow in developing an offer? I hesitate
asking for an appraisal because frankly, I  don't trust the people
in the business to keep my interest confidential, and that could
cause the price to  go up. I don't think having the .com domain is
vital, because most of my traffic is non-repetitive traffic  from
search engines, and that generally comes from a hyperlink, not from
the name remembered.

I want to  offer enough to make it worth his while, but not so much
that he might say, "Hey, I'd better find out why this guy thinks
it's worth so much!"

Any suggestions?
Thanks.
Frank.

[The Moderator]
At the time I was involved in buying a high-profile domain name
bts.com we managed to convince the seller that we we're a small
company who was interested in the
domain name so even though it was still a good price for the seller,
he didn't try to overprice it. It went for US$ 35.000.

More Good Tidings for Online Marketing in 2003

A number of forecasters have predicted that the online marketing
industry has turned the corner and will  return to solid growth next
year, as the economy improves and traditional marketers begin to
shift more  spending online. In recent weeks, a variety of
publishers --such as Yahoo!, ESPN.com, and the online units  of the
The New York Times and The Washington Post -- have come out with
bullish reports on their online  advertising revenues.

a previously announced restructuring.

==> TOPIC: DOMAIN PRIZE WAR

From: Drew Gardner <drew@iqmc.com>

Precana Thompson posted in I-Domain#188

>> Here is a press release I am working on to educate on the
impending Domain Name Price War. You might find it interesting. <<

Impending? There's been a price war (to the benefit on domain
owners) ever since competition was introduced.

As for resellers being taken out of the market by undercutting
registrars, that's just a natural progression and efficiency
increase.

There will always be room for resellers, who will use the actual
domain registration as a loss-leader, making their money from
value-added services and superior end-user support. And they're
going to buy straight from COMPETENT registrars who have established
a track record (like OpenSRS), rather than inserting yet _another_
link in the chain.

Your site looks like nothing more than an MLM scheme - keyword
"matrix", which makes your "press release" a rather poorly disguised
advert for a service I can't see anyone needing.

>> Soon very soon, the only hope for resellers will be domain name
brokers like CashBack Alliance.com. <<

Can you expand on what exactly make "cashback alliance" a domain
name broker? Thanks,
