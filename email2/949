We're back! List-Etiquette took a short break, but now we're up
and ready to handle your list-etiquette and management problems.

One controversial topic has been cropping up on a couple of
discussion groups I belong to: on-list and off-list discussion. But,
it's not what you think.

Most of the time, we think of on-list/off-list problems as people 
taking up space to post irrelevant messages, no matter how many 
people plead with them to "take the discussion off-list."

Instead, some moderators are finding more members requesting
information to be sent to them off-list, even when it's relevant
to the group discussion.

Should you, as a moderator, overrule the person requesting the 
information and ask that it be provided on the list?

Yes, depending on the request. "Relevance" can mean two things: 
relevance to the group's topic, focus or interest, and relevance to 
the group members if they all share certain characteristics, even 
if those characteristics aren't part of the group focus.

For example, you belong to a writers' list that focuses only on 
finding paid writing work. If a member of the group needs 
information on how to file for a copyright, another list member
could post that information on the list, because it would be 
relevant to the group, even though it's not a lead for paid work.

However, if the information provokes a discussion or controversy
that's unrelated to the request, or if it otherwise threatens to
derail conversation from the list's focus, then the administrator 
should step in and ask that it go off-list.

If you're a group member, you should first ask the list moderator 
if you can request that the information be posted publicly. If
the moderator declines, then send a private note to the person
asking for the information.


See you next time!
