Transferring LPs & Cassettes to CD with Toast 5 Titanium

Probably the most-asked question we get here at the newsletter is
how to record old LPs and cassettes onto CD. Admit it, you've missed
listening to them, but are just too lazy to fire up the turntable, if
you even have one anymore. Whether you record your own albums, or your
parents' collection, you'll rediscover a wealth of good tunes in the
process. And the same technique can be applied to voice recordings.
Michael Murie tells you everything you need to know about transferring
your LPs and cassettes to CD with Toast 5 Titanium here.

ROXIO USER PROFILE:
Swing Band Creates Demo CD with Toast

Duncan Jones, pianist with The Dezie McCullers Orchestra in Detroit,
Michigan, uses Toast and Spin Doctor to help his 17-piece big band
put together a demo CD for clients and prospective customers. Says
Jones: "We've got a band of mostly old guys who've been around the
music business for a lo-o-ong time! The group really swings, but all
the big name bands here, around Detroit, get the big pay gigs."

The band really needed some studio time to make a quality demo, but
the output of cash held them back. So Jones decided to listen to some
of the live stereo cassette tapes they'd recorded over the years, at
parks, big summer festivals, and private affairs. Sometimes they just
held a stereo microphone in front of the band, or took a recording
directly off the P.A. mix. According to Jones, "Sometimes they were
pretty bad, but others sounded all right!"

So he loaded some of the best tracks into Spin Doctor, and used its
power to clean up and "punch" up the sound. Next, he ported it over
to Toast and started to pull together a good usable demo. Now they're
deciding whether to use whole tracks, or just sections from each track,
and fade them in and out.

Jones says, "the project is going alright, and the demo CD looks
like a winner! Toast is making it easy. I know we're not up to
broadcast standards, but we'll have something to hand out, and
Toast will make it easy to customize, and run a quick 10 copies
at a time. Thanks, Roxio!"

Duncan, thanks for sharing your experience! Each newsletter, we'll
profile a Roxio user in this space. If you have an interesting story
to tell, or are using Roxio software in a unique way, let us know 
at Mailto:CommunityMac@roxio.com, and you might be the next to be 
featured! All profilees will receive a free Roxio software package.

enhanced to support multiple G4 processors, speeding the encoding
process. It also offers more accurate preservation of color and

Q: I upgraded to Jaguar, but my SCSI CD recorder is no longer
recognized. What's up?

A: Toast 5.2 and above are fully compatible with Jaguar. An issue
remains with CD Spin Doctor where you cannot export directly to Toast
via the Export button. Instead manually drag and drop your tracks from
the CD Spin Doctor window directly into the Toast Audio window.

In addition, Apple has made some changes in Jaguar that affect how
SCSI drives are recognized. After installing Mac OS 10.2, it is possible
the operating system will no longer see your drive as a CD recorder,
only as CD player. Toast depends on the driver information from the
operating system to determine the capabilities of a drive, and as such,
will only see the drive as a CD player. You will not be able to
record discs with Toast. As this is a Mac OS 10.2 issue, it affects
recording through DiscBurner and iTunes as well. Apple has released
updates to Jaguar. In addition to other changes, they have addressed
some issues related to SCSI recorders, so be sure you have the
latest version.
