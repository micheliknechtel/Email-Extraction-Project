"My children are often quite irresponsible with my money, and why shouldn't
they be?" says New Yorker writer David Owen. "But they are extremely careful
with their own." That's because he devised a new way to teach them about
money, not the punitive parent-induced savings plan too many kids know, but
a real-world way of saving, investing, and managing money. He calls it THE
FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF DAD, and now he shares his secrets with parents
everywhere.

One in ten Americans tells the other nine how to vote. And where to eat.
And what to buy, where to vacation, and on and on. Who are they?  They're
THE INFLUENTIALS.  Not necessarily the most educated or most affluent but
always the most engaged, they're simply the most important target for every
marketer. Now, RoperASW researchers Edward Keller and Jonathan Berry show
you how to reach them. And they'll do the rest.

In a global economy, old-fashioned sales just won't sell...luckily, you've
got Dale Carnegie on your side! The new sales person must learn to find
prospects even in unlikely places, to understand needs and motives, to move
beyond price...in short, to sell from the buyer's point of view. THE SALES
ADVANTAGE shows you how. It's essential reading for everyone who sells.
