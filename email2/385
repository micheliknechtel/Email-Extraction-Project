___________________________________________________
We've just added two new items to the home page of Thunder Valley Racing.

'Behind Every Driver is a Story to Tell', by Teresia Yetman, should give you
something to think about.

Also, I'm taking a little break, so I've reprinted one of my favorite
Editor's Notebook columns, 'To a Younger Sister', from March of 2000.  If
you missed it then (or have forgotten some of it), you'll want to take a
look.

As always, 'Breaking News' about women in motorsports can be found on the
home page and we've added a bunch of new women racers to the 'Racer
Profiles'.

Join the conversation about women and all things racing.

Yours 'til the Green,

T.W.
