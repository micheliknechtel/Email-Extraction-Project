Boy did the market get excited yesterday about President Bush's
proposed dividend-tax cut. And investors were quick to react, sending
share prices of 12 of the top 15 dividend-payers in the S&P 500 up
yesterday. But did anyone bother to look at that list of the Top 15?
Many of them are stocks you'd be certifiable to buy right now. Why?
Because their dividends are high due to the fact their stock prices have
tanked. Some of the 15 will likely cut or drop their dividends shortly
to reflect their diminished state of affairs. And therein lies the
lesson -- there is no panacea when it comes to the government trying to
juice the markets. Take a look at why dividends aren't the do-all and
end-all, along with a Consumer Reports rating of top cell-phone
companies and a Resident Authority on how tech consultants are
supplanting plumbers as the most sought-after home handy-person, in
today's Personal Finances pages.

The moral: A dividend is only as valuable as the company it keeps...

ASSESSING THE TOP 15 DIVIDEND PAYERS

New York: A look at the top 15 dividend payers among America's largest
companies would make any investor salivate -- especially since returns
would be enhanced if President Bush's expected proposal to cut dividend
taxes goes through.

BUSH PLAN STOKES MARKET

Washington: It didn't take a proposal to cut shareholder taxes by $300
billion to put the once-ignored corporate dividend back in the
spotlight. But it didn't hurt, either.

CAN THEY HEAR US NOW?

San Francisco: Cell-phone companies have a long way to go to improve
their standing with customers, a third of whom are searching for a
better deal, according to a new survey.

WHERE TO INVEST IN 2003

Boston: Investors are glad to say goodbye to 2002. With all three major
market indices falling for a third year in a row, the sting of "holding
on for the long run" has become unbearable for many individual
investors.

CHOOSING A TAX EXPERT

San Francisco: When it comes to seeking a tax preparer, choosing among
all the CPAs, CFPs and EAs can be as complex as doing your taxes
themselves.

tax bill.

IT IS THE ECONOMY, STUPID

New York: In moving up the release of his stimulus plan and broadening
it as well, President Bush has learned a valuable lesson from his
father: when all is said and done, it's the economy that's most
important to the electorate, and people don't like what they see right
now.

EDITORS MIXED ON BUSH ECON PLAN

Annandale, Va: The stock market clearly likes what it has heard so far
about President Bush's economic stimulus plan. On Monday alone the Dow
Jones Industrial Average rose by 2 percent and the Nasdaq Composite by
2.5 percent.

STATE STREET MANAGER THINKS SMALL

Boston: Admittedly he's biased, but Tucker Walsh thinks small-cap
stocks will be the place to be in 2003.

THE 7 DEADLY SINS OF MUTUAL FUNDS

Los Angeles: The small investor lost a hero in Arthur Levitt when he
resigned as the SEC's "top-cop," but he's returned with a new book
that's sure to be a rallying cry for all who are fed with the mutual
fund industry today.
