Bush’s speech may have been today, but the rally was
yesterday. Plus: good news from EMC, and a strike at
GE?

<br>
Jan 07 2003<br>
By Andy Serwer<br>
Fortune.com<br><br>
Chicago! Chicago! Hey, forget about Catherine Zeta-Jones,
the real star of the Windy City today was President
George W. Bush, who announced his economic stimulus
plan. Bottom line: It had all pretty much been leaked
out. Market already rallied off this one on Monday, so
we didn’t get a rerun on Tuesday. A rosy forecast from
EMC helped techs. The Dow fell 32 to 8740, while the Naz
climbed 10 to 1431. Hey watch me, Joseph Campbell (Follow
your bliss, kids, always follow your bliss…), I mean
Andy Serwer, on CNN’s "American Morning with Paula
Zahn," and Headline News. Read Loose Change to get my
take on LL Cool J. Here’s wazzup:

<P>STOCKYARD: As for W.’s plan, a little bigger than we
had thought--$674 million--but eliminating the dividend
cut. A vigorous defense was mounted however by Don Evans
and others, claiming the Dem plan was lame. Now the fun
begins as Congress hashes it out. I really think that W.
has done a pretty good job of preempting the Dems. Who
knows if any of these plans work? Deficit looming larger.
Wonder if the <i>NYT</i> is right that 1) this whole
dividend thing was Charles Schwab’s idea; and 2) if it
will make muni bonds less attractive and thereby increase
borrowing costs for states. Note that states where Dems
are more ascendant gets more from the Dem plan than from
W.’s plan. Coincidence? Me thinks not! Hey, I know!
Let’s give a tax break to North Korea! Buy ‘em out. We
pay Kim Jong Il money, he leaves and gives us nukes!
Hey, GE’s big union is calling a big national strike.
Issues over medical benefits. Hey, Jeff Immelt! Didn’t
you come from medical systems? Heard about this big
brouhaha over Coca-Cola and some bottling plant in India
where Coke is suing over water. Anyone know about that?
So, EMC FINALLY HAD SOME GOOD NEWS! Outlook is better
and stock climbs 66 cents to $7.46…Have you checked out
Porsche’s new SUV, the Cayenne? WHAT a tamale! </P><P>GRIM
HEADLINE OF THE DAY: "World airline industry loses $13
billion in 2002." Fly me to the moon…</P><P>BEARS: Do
you know from bears? I know Grizzlies, blacks, polars,
etc, but I’m reading a pretty good book by Lynn Schooler
(a he) called "Blue Bear," which he says is a rare kind
of bear in lower Alaska also known as the glacier bear.
Only thing is when I look ‘blue bear’ up, it looks like
the blue bear is just a phase that a common black bear
goes through. Huh? Help me out on this one!

<P>BIG SHOUT TO ANYONE IN LITTLE ROCK! Tell me your
favorite restaurant there! E-mail me! </P>Loose Change<br>HEY,
THE CANCUN RECOMMENDATIONS are coming on Thursday. Stay
tuned! DEEP BLUE ON STIMULUS PLAN: "They should just
give the big cuts to folks with AGI under 50k. They'll
spend it, generate sales tax $$, and put it back in the
economy -- People like me and you will just sit on it
and put in a college fund. We are too practical. Here is
what I want with my tax cut -- <A HREF="http://www.indecherub.com/Classics/cc_cruiser20.htm">The
Independence Classic</A> be still my nautical heart…this
boat is so, so cool...beyond cool -- it's fiberglass,
but looks like a woodie from the 1920's. I'd throw in a
240-horsepower Mercury Sport Jet, bow thruster and the
double cockpit. I'm King of Lake George! For $55,000."
Great idea, Blue! READER SAYS: "I read the NY Times on
my commute in and they always refer to the results of
any tax relief as 'costing the government $X billion'
rather than 'Saving the taxpayers $X billion.' Why the
phraseology (I say it's liberal bias)? I have written
countless letters to the editor to no avail. It's our
money in the first place. Did the quarter I declined to
give to the homeless man on the subway this morning cost
him 25 cents?--Matthew"…ALSO: "As with you, Yahoo Finance
was down for me yesterday morning. I stepped over to a
friend’s (pretty hardcore tech person, mind you) office
to see if they could get to it...they could. So I asked,
‘If we're in the same office, why can you get to it and
I can't?’ ‘I don't know,’ she replied, ‘maybe you hit a
bad hub.’ Believe or not, she said, ‘You should reboot
and see if you hit a good one...’ So I did, and it
worked. It's great working for a technology giant!"…AS
FOR THE GIANTS, hey, it’s ALL the ref’s fault. Him and
Cris Collingworth! Can’t believe Pitt beat ND! Is Pitt
really any good? Went to a Columbia Lions hoops game
last night. More people went to my high school games!
Heartbreak! Lions lost to Sacred Heart (Fairfield, CT)
on a 3-point shot with two seconds left! Pioneers had
kids from all over--only two from CT--favorite was named
Mading Mading from somewhere in Africa. He didn’t play…LL
Cool J. does "Harry Potter:" "It’s Slitherin, baby! Go
ahead, baby!" Yeah!
