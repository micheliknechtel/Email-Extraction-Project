Konica Digital Revio KD-400Z 

For people who want good pictures with a minimum of button pushing and 
fiddling with settings Konica offers the Digital Revio KD-400Z, a 
4-megapixel digital camera that does everything with little input 
needed. Serious photographers won't like the lack of manual settings, 
but the KD-400Z managed to take very good shots without them.
