THE OLD LANDS' END 2003 ALMANAC

Ah, the age-old question=2E

What kind of winter are we in for?

For over 200 years, eager readers have sought the answer in the pages of Th=
e Old Farmer's Almanac=2E

The cover of our January Lands' End catalog pays tribute to this venerable =
American institution=2E

The weather sages of Dublin, New Hampshire, are justly renowned for the unc=
anny accuracy of their forecasts - a batting average of around 80% when che=
cked against the actual weather recorded by the National Weather Service=2E

In 1942, when a German spy was captured after landing on Long Island, a cop=
y of the Almanac was found on his person=2E Even the spy masters were looki=
ng to New Hampshire for their weather predictions=2E

While the Almanac now relies on the full panoply of forecasting tools that =
modern meteorological science has at its disposal, there's another, somewha=
t mysterious piece to the puzzle - a black tin lockbox=2E

Since 1971, the black box has resided in the office of editor-in-chief Jud =
Hale=2E The box and its contents were entrusted to Mr=2E Hale by his predec=
essor in the editor's chair, Rob Sagendorph=2E Guardianship of the mysterio=
us black box has followed an unbroken chain of succession reaching all the =
way back to Robert B=2E Thomas, who founded the Almanac in 1792=2E

You're wondering what's in the box, right?

It's nothing less than the forecasting formula used by Mr=2E Thomas himself=
=2E And it's a secret as jealously guarded as the recipe for the Colonel's =
chicken=2E

While the folks at the Almanac won't divulge the precise nature of their me=
thod (we asked), they assured us that their particular variety of weather p=
rognostication didn't involve anything that could be deemed =22folklorish=
=2E=22

No heed is paid to the woolly worm caterpillar=2E Nor to the relative deart=
h or abundance of fruit on the branches of local pear trees=2E And while th=
ey were aware of a farmer in Canada who derived his own forecasts through t=
he keen examination of pig spleens, they were inclined to regard such pract=
ices as humbug=2E

Although a pear tree was observed growing outside Mr=2E Hale's office windo=
w=2E

Mere coincidence?

=22Pay no attention to that pear tree,=22 we were told=2E

And that's good enough for us=2E
