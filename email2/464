Today in Science/Astronomy:

* Way-Out World: New Technique Finds Most Distant Planet Ever
http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planet_transit_030106.html

The most distant known planet, a large and hot world pelted by iron rain and orbiting a star about 5,000 light-years away, has been found with a new and promising search technique.

* Milky Way's Central Black Hole Captured by Chandra
http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/cosmic_monster_030106.html

The longest X-ray look yet at the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's center has given astronomers unprecedented access to its life and times. The new data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory revealed that our galaxy's central black hole is a frequent bad actor, prone to numerous outbursts and occasional large explosions.

* Puzzling Ring of Stars Discovered Circling the Milky Way
http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/milkyway_ring_030106.html

Astronomers have discovered portions of what appears to be a giant, donut-shaped ring of previously unseen and surprisingly old stars surrounding our Milky Way Galaxy. If an entire ring exists, theorists might have to rethink details of how the galaxy formed.

* The American Astronomical Society Conference 2003
http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/aas2003_special_report.html

Welcome to SPACE.com's complete coverage of the 201st meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) in Seattle, Washington.

* Astronotes: Coldest, Faintest Star Ever Discovered
http://www.space.com/news/astronotes-1.html

A dim and small star only twice as hot as your kitchen oven has been found about 19 light-years from Earth. The star, a so-called brown dwarf, is hardly heavier than Jupiter and does not contain enough mass to jumpstart the thermonuclear fusion that powers real stars.

Today in SpaceFlight:

* Titan 2 Lifts Military Research Satellite Into Earth Orbit
http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/titan2_launch_030106.html

A $224 million mission to study wind patterns over the Earth's oceans and watch for coronal mass ejections from the Sun soon will begin thanks to the successful delivery to orbit Monday of the Coriolis spacecraft.

* Tech Today: First Commercial Maglev Train Rides Above the Rails in Shanghai
http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/tech_today.html

It floats through the air with the greatest of gauss; "gauss" - rhymes with "out" - being a measure of magnetic force

* Report: Pilot of China's First Manned Spacecraft Named
http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/chen_long_030106.html

Over the weekend, China television (CCTV) broadcast an intriguing behind-the-scenes look at preparations for sending Chinese astronauts aloft, perhaps later this year. Post-landing video of Sunday's touchdown of the Shenzhou 4 reentry module clearly showed at least two heavily instrumented mannequins inside the recovered spaceship.

* After Shenzhou - China's Space Plans Boosted Following Successful Mission
http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/after_shenzhou4_030105.html

After orbiting Earth for nearly a week, a reentry section of China's Shenzhou 4 spacecraft touched down early Sunday evening (Beijing time) in Inner Mongolia.

Today in Business/Industry:

* Study: Missile Defense Could Cost $1.2 Trillion
http://www.space.com/spacenews/

A newly released study prepared jointly by a pair of arms control advocacy groups puts the total life-cycle cost for a layered missile defense system at nearly $1.2 trillion through 2035.
