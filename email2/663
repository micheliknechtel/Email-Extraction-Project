Greetings ET lovers,

It looks like Peter Pan will be heading to court some time 
soon. 

A Canadian author is taking a British children's hospital to
court over the rights to the fairy tale hero Peter Pan. When
the story's creator James M. Barrie gave the copyright to
London's Great Ormand Street Hospital for Sick Children, it
alloted the care center donations by any director or merchan-
diser who wished to use images of the characters.  

However, author Emily Somma feels that the tale of Peter, 
Wendy, Tinker Bell and Captain Hook belongs to the public and
has filed a suit against the hospital. Book Magazine reports
that the reason Somma is taking such actions is because the
hospital will likely file suit against her to halt the pub-
lication of Somma's "After the Rain: A New Adventure for Peter 
Pan," a story in which Peter Pan is taken away from Neverland 
to grow up. 

Perhaps both sides should take some hints from Peter and grow
up themselves.

That's all folks!
Dante

         FIRST SEPT. 11 FEATURE TO OPEN IN MARCH

The first feature film to examine the tragic events of Sept.
11, 2001 and their aftermath, is scheduled for release this
March. Based on Anne Nelson's play of the same name, "The
Guys" is a powerful and unexpectedly humorous film about a
New York City journalist (Sigourney Weaver) enlisted to help
a fire captain (Anthony LaPaglia) write eulogies for the
eight men he lost in the World Trade Center. As the fireman
begins to open up and work through his grief, the two form
an unexpected bond. Producers of the film say they hope it
will help the audience rediscover the quiet heroism that in-
forms everyone's daily lives. Although several documentaries
have chronicled the terrorist attacks on New York and sev-
eral feature films have been shot there since Sept. 11 "The
Guys" is the first motion picture to dramatize the tragedy.
Focus Features released "The Guys" in Los Angeles on Dec.
13, 2002 for a one-week, awards-qualifying run at Pacific
Theatres' The Grove Stadium 14. The film will begin its gen-
eral theatrical release March 28.

           Nature's new secret weapon for 
          RAPID AND PERMANENT WEIGHT LOSS! 

If you've been taking chitosan to lose weight, you may be 
close to the secret of RAPID WEIGHT LOSS. But, chitosan is 
only part of the secret. Since D-Glucosamine is the only 
active ingredient in chitosan, taking just one tablet is 
equivalent to absorbing nearly a full bottle of chitosan. 

Yet, D-Glucosamine is as safe as nature intended it to be. 
Promotes fast, permanent results... unlike any other diet 
booster we've seen. ORDER NOW by visiting!

              GIBSON RECALLS 'UNEXPLAINABLE' RESCUE

"Signs" star Mel Gibson may not believe in little green men
from outer-space, but that doesn't mean he dismisses the un-
explainable. Talking to reporters in New York about his new
alien drama, Gibson recalled a car accident he had in
Australia when he was 21 that probably should have ended his
life. Explaining how he was "doing about 95 in my little
four-cylinder Ford, little junkbox" from Adelaide to Sydney,
the 47-year-old actor said he drove off a rain-slicked road
while impatiently trying to pass a truck. "So, I swerved
away and there was a truck coming in the other direction,"
Gibson explained. "I'm really cooked here and so I swung
out of the way and lost all control of the steering and it
was just gonna go over the cliff. I remember before I cover-
ed up in a crouch position and let go of the steering wheel
into the hands of the Almighty there was a massive gum tree
coming right at me at a very rapid speed. Just before (the
car) went down over the cliff I covered my head and said a
very short prayer and felt this, 'Bang, boom.' I took my
hands off and the big gum tree was pressed against one side
of the car door and had dented it in. The other side of the
car was a sapling and I had been caught between the two
trees and the front wheels were hanging over the abyss. I
had to crawl over the front seat and get out the back doors
because the front doors were jammed from these two trees."
He concluded: "I kind of thought that was pretty wild to
get caught by a couple of saplings before going over a
cliff, not getting hit by either of the trucks, so some-
body had his hand on me that day. It's things like that
that inform you of something greater than yourself walk-
ing with you."  "Signs" comes to video stores Tuesday.

            WALKEN: I WANTED TO BE MORE ROMANTIC

When casting romantic leads, the command producers don't
usually bark: "Get me Christopher Walken!" The veteran of
some 100-odd films says he doesn't know why that is. "I
actually wanted to be more romantic," confesses the 59-year
-old "Deer Hunter" and "Pulp Fiction" star. "I could sort
of see myself on a horse with a hat, sort of a cowboy,
romantic." An accomplished dancer and charming comic actor,
the native New Yorker is better known for his portrayal of
quirky, sinister characters, usually in crime or war dramas.
However, his halting speech and serious facial expressions
have fueled his image as a scary individual in real life,
as well. Asked if he is aware some folks actually are
afraid of him, Walken dismisses the question, noting," I
hear that, you know, but I think that if that's true that
it has to do with the movies that I've done." And the nutty
characters he has played? "Yeah, you know, I've had guns
and things," he remarks. Walken can now be seen in the
action comedy "Catch Me If You Can."
