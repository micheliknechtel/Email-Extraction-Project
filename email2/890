Article of the Week:
Microsoft Works Suite 2003 Review

It seems like heresy, but let's admit it: Most home PC users and families
don't need the muscle and bulk of Microsoft Office. In this first of a
three-part series, we look at the software giant's more affordable
alternative, Works Suite 2003 -- and find lots to like, one lopsided
negative, and the best program that Microsoft refuses to market.

Microsoft Works Suite 2003 Review
Right-Sized Software, Part I

It's both a glaringly obvious fact and the dirty little secret of the
software market: Most consumers, especially home-PC-using families, don't
need a full-powered, feature-packed office suite.

In addition to e-mail and Web surfing, the typical family divides its
computing time between light correspondence and maybe home budgeting for the
grownups and schoolwork and creative projects -- such as greeting cards or
tinkering with digital photos -- for the kids. Throwing such users in at the
deep end or expecting them to use more than 10 percent of -- or pay the $479
price of -- mighty Microsoft Office is absurd.

In the DOS days, people knew better, and Microsoft's entry-level integrated
package, Works, was joined by several equally affordable alternatives.
Today, most software is as supersized as most fast-food meals and SUVs, yet
there are a few programs that manage to be scaled down without being dumbed
down.

This week, we open a three-part family-software ("Family Feud"?) series with
a look at the best known -- Microsoft Works Suite 2003
(http://www.microsoft.com/works; $109 with a $15 mail-in rebate), which
bundles the latest version of Works with five other titles ...

Microsoft Launches Windows Media 9, Updated Player and Movie Maker
New versions of Windows XP's Media Player and Movie Maker (free) and a
party-jukebox Plus pack ($20) are just part of Microsoft's new plan to set
the standard for high-quality streaming audio and video: The software
giant's licensing its copy-protection-friendly technologies at half the cost
of rivals such as MPEG-4. (http://www.winplanet.com/winplanet/news/4615/1/)
