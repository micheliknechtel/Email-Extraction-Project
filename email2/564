IWF EMAIL UPDATE

IWF RELEASES AGENDA FOR WOMEN 2003

The Independent Women’s Forum (IWF) has released its Agenda for Women 2003, a plan of action that “recognizes there are many factors that determine quality of life for today’s women and that political and legal manipulations designed to paint American women as victims only harm us,” according to Nancy M. Pfotenhauer, IWF President. 

IWF's Agenda for Women 2003 tackles a wide range of issues that, taken together, will foster equal opportunity for women while guaranteeing that individual women have the freedom to make individual choices.

IWF JOINS AMICUS BRIEF IN GRUTTER v. BOLLINGER AND GRATZ v. BOLLINGER RACIAL PREFERENCES CASES 

IWF joins The Center for Equal Opportunity and The American Civil Rights Institute in filing the brief which documents the University of Michigan Law School’s system for giving greater weight to the applications of racial and ethnic minority students despite a disparity in academic qualifications between minority students and other students. 

Nancy M. Pfotenhauer, IWF President, notes that such unconstitutional preferences are unnecessary to support the academic aspirations of minority students. “In states where racial and ethnic preferences have been ended - California, Texas, Florida, and Washington - minority enrollment has, in almost all cases, increased since the discriminatory policies were abolished,” she says. 

While the IWF strongly believes in equal opportunity, we oppose the use of quotas whether overt or de facto. Quotas, which mandate equal outcomes, are the antithesis to equal opportunity.

TAKE BACK THE CAMPUS!

With noted scholar, author, and IWF National Advisory Board Chairman Christina Hoff Sommers leading the charge, the Independent Women’s Forum will bring commonsense feminism to campuses nationwide. On January 30th we’ll kick off our campaign to "Take Back the Campus" with students at the University of Chicago as they host Dr. Hoff Sommers for a lively discussion about the future of feminism.

“In my book, Who Stole Feminism,” says Dr. Sommers, “I question the basic premise of the contemporary American feminist movement: that American women are oppressed. I do not believe that women in contemporary American society are oppressed; they do not constitute a subordinate class. I believe American women are among the freest and most liberated in the world. It is no longer reasonable to say that as a group women are worse off than men.” 

And so begins the highly anticipated “Sex, Lies, & Feminism” speech that Dr. Sommers will deliver to a crucial audience-college women and men.

IWF URGES TITLE IX COMMISSION TO END PROPORTIONALITY, ASKS FOR MORE REALISTIC VIEW ON WOMEN, MEN, AND SPORTS  

As the Commission on Opportunity in Athletics prepares to make recommendations to Education Secretary Rod Paige next week regarding the implementation of Title IX, the Independent Women’s Forum urges the Commission to bring an end to the current proportionality test.

The original intent of Title IX was to prohibit sex discrimination in federally-funded educational programs. It was never intended to function as a quota system. Instead, a policy of proportionality has been implemented by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE)--placing unrealistic demands on colleges and institutionalizing discrimination against men. 

IWF representatives will participate in press conferences on Tuesday and Wednesday calling for an end to institutionalized discrimination against men. Check our website on Monday for details: www.iwf.org
