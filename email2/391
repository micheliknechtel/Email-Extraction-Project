DEAR JOHN: My husband ``Ted'' and I have been married for 26 years and
have two children. For the past 10 years, Ted has initiated conversations
with women that become all-night telephone gabfests. Most of the time, the
topic is his relationship with me. Although Ted promises to cease bringing
me up to these strangers, he continues to do so.

Recently I walked in on Ted's ``speakerphone'' conversation with a younger
co-worker. He got off that phone in a flash and acted as if nothing was
ever said. Again I brought my disappointment about this behavior to his
attention, and he had the audacity to deny having the conversation. When
that didn't work, he proceeded to blame me for eavesdropping, as if he was
the victim and I'm the bad guy!

I'm the one who ended up sleeping on the couch for a week, standing up to
him. I've told him repeatedly how this hurts my self-esteem and how it's
proof that he takes my love for granted, to no avail. I'm the only one he
loves, his soul mate, he tells me. Yet, I feel so betrayed. Why does he
find it easier to talk to them? -- Down and Discouraged in Texas

DEAR DOWN AND DISCOURAGED: To get these women's attention, Ted has to play
on their sympathies by making them feel sorry for him. He's chosen to make
you the ``issue,'' and that is a shame. Not only does it do you a
disservice since you can't defend yourself, but it misleads these women as
well. You've repeatedly asked him to stop. His continued actions are proof
that their empathy is more important to him than your feelings.

Successful relationships are built on mutual trust and respect. To date,
yours lacks both. If you are both willing to work on the relationship, ask
him to go with you to counseling. If he refuses, then ask him to leave.
It's time for you to let him know that his behavior is abusive and that
you won't tolerate it any more.

DEAR JOHN: I loved reading your list of Random Acts, which appeared
recently in your Mars Venus Relationship Tips. It reminded me of the kind
acts my husband shared with me before his untimely death. Shortly before
my husband died, he told a friend that marrying me was the best decision
he ever made in his life. None of his Random Acts were very big, just
consistent and constant. I feel we had more in our short five years than
many people have in 20 years. Random Acts really work! -- Missing Him in
Del Mar, Calif.

DEAR MISSING HIM: I'm glad you agree with my premise that every little
gesture of kindness we show our loved one is acknowledged and appreciated.
Readers, if you missed it the first time around, here are the four Random
Acts of Kindness I mentioned:

Act No. 1: Pamper your partner. Have a warm bubble bath waiting. When she
gets out of the tub, give her a rubdown with a scented oil. Spoil her with
a pedicure. As she unwinds, she'll appreciate knowing that she's your
``baby.''

Act No. 2: Kiss and cuddle. Our bodies crave touch. So be there with a
kiss, or hug her whenever the mood strikes. By doing so, you open the door
to random acts from her.

Act No. 3: Shower him with compliments. Thank him for his kind acts toward
you. Remind him how much he means to you. Each night, name three reasons
why you appreciate him. By knowing he's your hero, he'll slay more dragons
in your honor.

Act No. 4: Send him your love. Leave love notes in his pockets. Send him a
daily love ``e-mail.'' Place candy kisses in his briefcase. Small
reminders reap big dividends of devotion. Readers, feel free to be
creative in your own actions. Then, write to me and share the responses
you had.

SIDEBAR: MARS AND VENUS / REDBOOK POLL

Three's a Crowd

When it comes to the bedroom, most women feel that three's a crowd,
according to a recent MarsVenus/Redbook poll.

Of the poll's 1,158 female participants, 52.1 percent claimed they would
never even consider a menage a trois. However, another 25.6 percent might
try it, depending on whom their bed partners were, and 9.9 percent would
do so in order to have said ``been there and done that.''

Then again, a full 10.4 percent feel that the more, the merrier, and don't
have qualms at all about sharing their beds.

Full poll results are shown below. To take part in this week's
MarsVenus/Redbook poll, log on to www.redbookmag.com.
