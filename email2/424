exonym (EK-so-nim) noun

   A name used by foreigners to refer to a place or people, instead of the
   name used by those who live there.
   For example: Cologne (native term: Koln), Florence (Firenze), 
   Japan (Nippon), Italy (Italia).

[From Greek ex- (out) + -onym (word, name).]

  "Roger Payne: ... Vienna being an exonym, which is a name that other
   people use, but the German or Austrian form is Wien."
   Renee Montagne; Interview: Roger Payne Discusses an International
   Conference to Standardize Geographic Names; Morning Edition (National
   Public Radio); Sep 2, 2002.

  "The exonyms Thai-Islam (from the part of the Siamese) and MalayMuslim
   (from the part of the Malaysians) present an image of the Jawi that is
   incomplete or pejorative in their eyes."
   Pierre Le Roux; To Be Or Not To Be...The Cultural Identity of the Jawi;
   Asian Folklore Studies (Nagoya, Japan); 1998.

"So difficult it is to show the various meanings and imperfections of words
when we have nothing else but words to do it with," wrote philosopher John
Locke (1632-1704). While there's truth in Locke's assertion, it's possible
to overcome the difficulty to some extent. We construct small unambiguous
building blocks, define them as precisely as we can, and then put them to
work for bigger purposes (though in some languages, such as German, we often
get carried away).

This week we feature word words, or meta-words, all of which end with the
combining form -onym (name or word).
