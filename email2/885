** Candy Crisis 
RECENTLY... a mad scientist at a candy factory unveiled his greatest creation: a batch of living candy, brought to life through the miracles of genetic mutation. Unfortunately, his formula had a fatal flaw-the living candy immediately began to multiply by the thousands! Within minutes, the plant began to overflow with candy. Luckily, a quick-thinking researcher quickly discovered how to fend off the rapidly multiplying creatures. The mutated candy became extremely reactive when grouped together - and when four of the same color touched, they would instantly vaporize! 

Candy Crisis is an exciting combination of pure action and puzzle gaming. you can pair off against a friend, and even specify a handicap so that both players are evenly matched. And if you don't want to play against an opponent, Solitaire Crisis mode allows you to practice without having to compete against an opponent. A tutorial is included with the game as well, so even puzzle novices can become Candy Crisis champions in no time. This game is shareware.
