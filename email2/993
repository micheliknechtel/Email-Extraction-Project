TOP NEWS

The National Academy of Sciences has selected 18 individuals to receive awards
honoring their outstanding scientific achievements. The awards will be presented
 on April 28 at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., during the Academy's 140th
annual meeting.

Transportation security, traffic congestion, safety and the reauthorization of
the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century are the featured topics of
discussion at one of the largest gatherings of transportation researchers and
practitioners in the world, the annual meeting of the National Academies'
Transportation Research Board. Meeting sessions and related events, which begin
on Sunday, Jan. 12, will cover policy and technical issues ranging across all
modes of transportation, from bicycles to supersonic jets. This year is the 82nd
 annual meeting, attracting more than 9,000 participants and including almost
550 sessions featuring 2,200 papers and presentations.

The U.S. Army needs a better plan and more funding to develop unmanned ground
vehicles for reconnaissance, surveillance and other combat operations, says a
new report from the National Academies' Board on Army Science and Technology.
The Army should focus on integrating key technologies such as perception,
navigation and communications to build vehicles that can travel autonomously and
 adapt to changing combat situations. Congress mandated in 2000 that at least
one of every three future army battle systems be unmanned.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other groups in the public
and private sectors should focus on 20 priority areas to improve health care
quality and delivery, says a new report from the Institute of Medicine of the
National Academies. Collective action in these areas could help transform the
entire health care system.
