Did this year's holiday spending leave you with a credit card
hangover?

If you did all of your holiday shopping on a credit card, you
would spend 2-3 times more once you figure in interest and
finance charges. In addition, most Americans think they will
have their holiday debt paid off by the end of February, when
it actually takes them about 6 months to pay it off. Don't
suffer the "post holiday blues" when the bills arrive in
January.

Consolidate Debt
by Scott Bilker
Fewer cards, more leverage

Scott,My husband and I are preparing to buy a new home. We
want to clean up our credit card accounts to better our
chances for a mortgage. We were considering paying off our
credit cards with smaller balances using other credit cards.
What is better when your credit is being considered for a home
loan--fewer credit cards with higher balances or more credit
cards with smaller balances? The cards we are planning to pay
off we are going to have closed so there are fewer credit
accounts opened. Is that a smart move?
Christina

That's a great question! I would have to say that having fewer
credit cards with higher balances is going to be "better" in
most cases. With fewer cards, you have a lower amount of
available credit and that is certainly a consideration when
banks review your credit report, or as I like to call it, your
"credit resume."

Let's look at a few numbers. Say you had three credit cards.
Each has a $5,000 limit and a balance of $1,000. At this point
you have a $15,000 limit and $3,000 debt. Many mortgage
lenders may view that as a possible unsecured debt of $15,000.

By consolidating all that to one card, you'd have a $3,000
balance with a $5,000 limit. That's certainly looks more
favorably to lenders.

Since you have many credit cards, you also have some options
to get some great rates! When deciding which credit cards to
use to consolidate your debts, be sure to give them a call.
Tell them, "Here's the deal. I'm consolidating all my debts to
the fewest cards possible and closing my other accounts. If
you want to keep making money, then you'll need to give me a
great rate or else I'm gone!" If the first rep can't do that,
then ask to speak to their supervisor.

In my opinion, a good rate is 4.9% fixed until it's paid off,
0% for one year, or a 9.99% fixed rate for life on all
purchases and charges. Your options will depend on your
history with each credit card and their thirst for profitable
customers.

When we purchased our house, we had 24 credit cards with a
total of $24,000 and still got approved for the mortgage! They
didn't say a word. The reason is because we've never had a
late payment. Paying on time is one of the most critical keys
to getting the best deals and having the most credit options.

One more tip. This is the exception for keeping your cash!
Don't reduce your debts by paying them off with cash because
you'll need that cash for the down payment and closing costs.
After you're in the new house, then pay off the credit cards
with any remaining cash.

Mexican Beans and Rice with Spicy Meatballs
courtesy of Chet's Crock
Easy crock pot meal

*  1 pound extra-lean ground beef
*  2 packages taco seasoning mix (1 1/4-ounce)
*  1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro or parsley
*  1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
*  1/3 cup finely chopped carrots
*  3 1/2 cups water
*  1 can sliced ripe olives (2 1/4 ounce), drained
*  1 can diced green chiles (7-ounce)
*  6 garlic cloves, minced
*  1 red bell pepper, diced
*  2 cups converted white rice
*  1 15-ounce can kidney beans, rinsed and drained

To make the meatballs, in a medium bowl, combine the ground
beef, 1/2 package taco seasoning mix, cilantro, breadcrumbs,
carrots, and 1/2 cup of the water. Mix to blend well. Roll
into 24 balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Set aside.

For the beans and rice, in a four or five quart electric slow
cooker, mix together the remaining three cups water with the
remaining taco seasoning mix, olives, green chiles, garlic,
bell pepper, and rice. Gently push the meatballs down into the
rice mixture.

Cover and cook on the low heat setting four hours, or until
the rice is just tender and the meatballs are cooked through.

Gently stir in the beans. Cover and cook 30 minutes longer.

Negotiating with the Typical Adjuster
y Dan Baldyga
Insurance claim tip

HOW TO PROCEED WITH THE CLAIMS ADJUSTER: Be pleasant, but
firm. No matter how much in the wrong the person is that hit
you, no matter how they acted at the scene of the accident,
and no matter what they may have verbalized to or at you, don
t take it out on the adjuster. It s not their fault if their
insured is an idiot.

Always show the adjuster you are willing to negotiate in good
faith and you understand the process. The first rule of
bargaining is never lower your demand until the adjuster makes
a counter-offer. If you lower your demand once or twice during
a single negotiation contact (whether in person or during a
telephone conversation) without the adjuster making a counter-
offer, you have revealed to him that your initial demand is
weak.

If you lower your demand wait until the adjuster makes a
counter-offer before reducing your demand a second time. Think
of a negotiation process as similar to selling a car or any
other property. You initially ask for more than you're willing
to accept and the potential buyer offers less than they're
willing to pay. After some negotiations you settle on a price
somewhere in the middle making both parties feel as if they
got a good deal.

To learn the value of the pain and suffering you experienced
(because of the injury you sustained) go to
http:www//autoaccidentclaims.com. There you will discover Auto
Accident Personal Injury Insurance Claim (How To Evaluate And
Settle Your Loss) and The BASE Formula (Baldyga Auto Accident
Settlement Evaluation Formula) which will tell you exactly how
much your discomfort is worth.

BE PATIENT: A claim settled in haste is rarely paid its fair
and full value.

THE ADJUSTERS CLAIM LOAD: The job performance of insurance
adjusters is judged not only on how little of the company's
money they spend in settlement. They're also expected to bring
each claim they are assigned to a conclusion as soon as
possible. They're under constant pressure from their superiors
to settle your claim; to get rid of it ad move on! The
adjuster will never tell you, but the weight of their caseload
comes down on your side of the scale. It is an advantage most
people are never aware of.

Off My Noodle
by Judy Gruen
The price is never right

I never would have suspected that when my friend Donna bought
her new area rug, it would doom our friendship. And yet,
sometimes it's these small encounters, when people think they
are making innocent chitchat about trifling economic
transactions, that can have unexpected ripple effects,
upsetting the entire chain of human relationships. Sadly, this
is what happened with Donna and me.

I probably should have seen it coming. Telling Donna about any
purchase I made has always been a mistake, because she has
always felt compelled to let me know that however much I had
spent on something, she had got her item cheaper. Usually a
lot cheaper.

Take the rug, for example, which is exactly what Donna did for
only fifteen bucks from a guy selling them on an empty street
lot in town. When Donna discovered that I had bought my area
rug from a retail establishment, a pained look came into her
eyes. Donna's philosophy of shopping is, if you bought it from
a place with a roof on it, you paid too much. And when I
confessed that I had performed this very sin in buying my rug,
I knew what was coming next. As usual, Donna asked me how much
I paid for it. And as usual, I lied. But I only did so for her
own benefit. I didn't think Donna couldn't take the truth.
What else can you expect from a woman whose hobby is watching
the Home Shopping Network and shouting at the television that
only a fool would pay that much for a set of ten gutter screws
or a four-foot tall lighted deer?

It's always been the same with Donna and me. Years ago, when I
showed her my new dining set, she managed to worm the price
out of me, then collapsed into a chair. Good thing I had
smelling salts around or she may never have recovered from the
shock. Naturally, she had found her dining set at a
liquidation sale of merchandise seized by the IRS. In fact,
all of Donna's furnishings and jewelry used to belong either
to drug warlords or tax delinquents who had their stuff carted
off by the government, only to have people like Donna swoop
down on it in far-flung parking lots, pouncing on the best
deals. It was hard to forgive Donna for ever telling me that
the price I paid for two of my dining chairs was more than
Donna paid for a whole table, two extension leaves and chairs
for twelve.

As a bargain hunter, I'll always be bush league compared to
Donna. When she saw that I bought my kids a plastic jungle gym
from Target, she burst with the information that she had found
hers at a garage sale for twenty-five bucks. In fact, I
realized that there is nothing in Donna's life that wasn't
discovered at a clearance outlet, garage sale, or by the side
of the freeway. I once tried to play her game, and thought
she'd be proud when I showed her some great fabric sizing and
canned green beans I bought at the ninety-nine cent store. But
Donna trumped me even here, as she gleefully told me about the
little-known existence of a ninety-eight-cent store, where she
buys all her non-perishable food items and detergent.

Donna even met her husband through a personal ad in the
Recycler newspaper. The ad read, "Original owner. Chassis like
new. Great for offroading. Make me an offer!" Obviously this
was a man right up Donna's bargain-hunting alley. I mean, how
many men come with their own smog certifications these days,
anyway?

But the way she rubbed my nose in her area rug, so to speak,
was the final straw. I have my pride. And while I like a sale
as much as anyone, I also don't think I need to perform hari-
kari if I sometimes pay retail, a word that makes every fiber
of Donna's being recoil in horror, disgust and loathing.

I bet that Donna's even written up in that book, "The
Millionaire Next Door." She makes a good living, but she's
never paid more than thirty bucks for anything, even a major
appliance. Well, I don't think all this competition over
bargains is worth it. Besides, I think the Home Shopping
Network's price for the gutter screws was pretty darned good.
I'm going to go turn on the set now and see if they're still
available. And if Donna happens to drop by unexpectedly to
lord it over me on some new purchase, mum's the word on where
I got the lighted deer.

                       Indoor Plant Help

I have found that my set back thermostat saves a great deal of
money on my heating bills every year. However, because my
house is at 55 degrees during the day while we are away from
home and 58 degrees when we are sleeping, I have had a great
deal of difficulty getting houseplants to grow. Even golden
pothos, which is supposed to be foolproof, does not thrive
here. Does anyone have suggestions on plants that will live
through these chilly winters and then into the summer when the
house (cooled by fans, not air conditioning) may get into the
low 80s occasionally?

                   Use Cash to Stay on Budget

I find that using cash for things like groceries and "fun
money" helps me. It forces me to stick to a budget. When the
money is gone, the shopping is over. For grocery shopping, I
make a combination weekly menu calendar/grocery list for the
fridge. I keep track of items I'll need at the store on the
list. When I'm at the store, I keep track of the costs of what
I'm picking up, either with a calculator or by writing (and
rounding up to the nearest half dollar) on my grocery list. If
I start to get close to my budget, I evaluate which items I
absolutely need now and which can be held over to the next
week's shopping trip.

My husband and I also have a "fun money" allowance. I take
mine out in cash. First, it keeps me more honest and it's
easier than trying to keep track of my unnecessary expenses.

                        Buying Cookware

I would not buy the copper-bottomed Regal set. After having a
set of copper-bottomed Revere Ware for 15 years, I splurged on
Calphalon stick-resistant. It was $200 for a nice set of five
pieces with the lids, on special four years ago.  It is by far
the best money I have ever spent. I am confident that I will
use these the rest of my life and pass them to my children.
Department stores often run specials on them like buying one
and getting another pan with it. I have bought pieces for
gifts in the $20 - $30 range.

My advice is take the money you would buy on a big set of less
expensive things, buy a good old-fashioned cast iron frying
pan, and add two Calphalon pans in the 1 to 2 quart range and
a big stock pot. If you need to spread out expenses, buy the
larger pan first, then the smaller and then the stockpot. Ask
for the pieces of the set for birthdays and Christmas. Most
people love to add to a set that they know you want. I would
rather have one heavy Calphalon or similar pan than 50 lighter
weight ones. The difference in cooking is unbelievable, as the
temperature is evenly spread. I have probably saved enough in
non-burned food to pay for them!

                  Penalty for Early Withdrawal

Rather than pay the penalties for early withdrawal of your CD,
talk to your bank about a loan against your CD. They only
allow a percentage of the CD, but it's much better than
closing the whole CD. You are borrowing against your own money
at a rate much less than other loans. As an added bonus, your
CD is still collecting interest. You can usually set the
repayment amounts. If you can't pay it back within the period
of the loan, then it comes out of the CD. What have you lost
if you were going to withdraw all of it anyway? I've done this
a couple of times.

                     Programmed for Savings

One of the best things we did for our home heating costs was
to purchase a programmable thermostat. Because nobody is home
during the day except the dogs, this works great for us. We
also turn it down at night when we are sleeping. If we get
chilly, we add more blankets. We have saved almost 30% on our
heating bill. Programmable thermostats will cost from $30 to
$100 depending on how many zones you have and if you have air
conditioning. It is as easy to install as a light switch. You
can get them at any hardware store and the clerk will help
with any installation questions. Remember to be safe because
you will be working with electricity.

                       Close the Windows

I have a suggestion for those that may be purchasing a new
computer or a refurb (just as good). This would also pertain
to those that may be experiencing major problems with the
computer that they already own.

And that suggestion is LINUX. Linux has come along way since
its inception. It has a GUI now and reminds me of the MAC
desktop. It's more stable than Windows will ever be, when
adding new hardware. (No more reboots!) You can pretty much do
anything with Linux, that one can do on Windows.

As time goes on, more and more applications will be 'ported'
to Linux. You can download most any 'distribution' of Linux
from the web for FREE! When was the last time Microsoft
offered Windows for FREE? For those that may have dialups or
just don't like downloading ISO files, I would like to
recommend visiting www.cheapbytes.com or www.cheapISO.com or
go to www.linuxtrader.com for a complete listing of cheap
Linux CD sites.

Also, you can get a complete FREE Office Suite, which is
completely Microsoft compatible, for those still using
Windows. It's called Openoffice, available at
www.openoffice.org . (also available for mac) There are
thousands of applications for Linux.

This is just an alternative to Windows. If we are considering
savings, this should be a major consideration.

                        Insurance Comment

I read the article "Insuring Your Possessions"
<http://www.stretcher.com/stories/02/02dec30c.cfm> and I have
an addition. I have been licensed for Property and Casualty
Insurance, which includes Homeowners and/or Renters Insurance.
For a homeowner, there are two categories of coverage on your
home, which are Actual Value and Replacement Cost.

Actual Value will only give the insured party the depreciated
cost of an item. If a TV cost $300 two years ago but now is
only worth $50, than $50 is all that will be paid by the
Insuring Company.

On the other hand, Replacement Cost will give the insured
party the replacement cost of an item that is lost, damaged,
or stolen. If a TV cost $300 two years ago but now the cost to
replace is $330 (as example), then the Insuring Company will
pay to the insured party $330. This type of coverage does cost
