Today's Internet Tip: Opening an HTML Page in Excel

For some time now, Excel has been "Web aware," meaning that the
program knows how to handle hyperlinks. You can add a hyperlink in a
document, click on that link, and Excel opens your Web browser and
displays the contents of that link in the browser. (You can also
create a hyperlink to other Office documents, including Excel
workbooks.) You can even create hyperlinks to different objects on
your worksheet, such as a command button in a form.

What if you want to start the browser and open an HTML file from
within a VBA macro, however? There are a couple of ways that you can
do this. The first is to simply open a new Internet Explorer object
within your code. A macro to do this would appear as follows:

Sub DoBrowse1()
Dim ie As Object
Set ie = CreateObject("Internetexplorer.Application")
ie.Visible = True
ie.Navigate "c:\temp\MyHTMLfile.htm"
End Sub

This macro will open the file c:\temp\MyHTMLfile.htm in a new Internet
Explorer window. If you want to instead open a Web page from over the
Internet, you can do so simply by changing where you want to navigate.
(Replace the file path with a URL.)

Another way to accomplish the same task is to rely on Excel to figure
out what your default browser is and open the HTML resource. The
following macro does the trick:

Sub DoBrowse2()
ActiveWorkbook.FollowHyperlink _
Address:="c:\temp\MyHTMLfile.htm", _
NewWindow:=True
End Sub

Again, the browser opens a new window and displays the specified file.
You can change the Address parameter to any URL that you desire.
