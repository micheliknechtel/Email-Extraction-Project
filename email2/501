I so agree with this statement.  What I find even more irritating is
when I want to get a quick price quote and have to fill in
everything from my name and address to my second cousin's favorite
ice cream flavor.  I am rarely ready to buy until I have done proper
research, and I often will leave a web site when the "irritation
factor" of form filling gets too high.

For that reason, I ensure that price and format of my products is up
front. I'll do business with someone I trust; I expect people will
do business with me if I am up front with them.

The possible reason for having a separate order page is because
there might be 2 different price structures.

It's possible that the appliance site your wanting to buy retail
parts/items from also has wholesale rates available for businesses
or dealers.

In summary, I agree that the option should come at the beginning of
the order and not at the point when you've already decided to buy. I
wouldn't take offense to this as the ecommerce software is most
likely written to perform/sequence the way that you've experienced.

==> IDENTIFY YOURSELF FIRST!

From:  Komra Moriko <komra@design4results.com>

I agree with Marcia about being forced to identify yourself as a
certain category of customer before buying a product. I hate it. I
recently bought a computer using the Gateway website, and wanted to
configure the system myself (that is what Gateway is all about,
right?). But they did not easily let me do it that way. Long story
short, I found a system - configured it - saved the quote.

Then *called* them because their website did not give me enough
assurance about when the computer would arrive for me to feel right
ordering online. I called their business number (I am a business,
however small, and had configured a system through the business
section of their site) and got shuttled -by a human being, fwiw-
over to their consumer line...

Given that experience, it is my take that companies insist on
categorizing their customers because it is how they operate
internally. It's no excuse, though, for not finding out how your
customers *really* want to use your site... usability testing that
makes a difference is easy to do... you can find and cure 80% of the
problems by watching and taking notes as 5-6 people use your site...
(one way mirrors not required!)

==> IDENTIFY YOURSELF FIRST!

From:  John McCabe <jmccabe@web-guides.com>

Marcia has some doubts about the process of identifying herself as a
"home business, small business or big business."

There are indeed some very plausible reasons for doing so.

One, as you mentioned, is selecting the products to be offered. As a
"one-man band" operating out of a home office, I have no real need
to wade through server networks, corporate site licensing, purchase
order procedures, and so on. If I want to buy a keyboard, I want to
see the keyboard, be able to order one without background check, and
pay with my company credit card.

Because of the relative simplicity of a one-off sale to an
individual, the price I pay may actually be lower. This information
could cause problems for the corporate buyer seeking 500 or 1,000
keyboards, along with support, stacked shipping dates and so on.

So, after taking the long way around, I guess my answer is no, I
don't mind identifying the group I'm in at all.

==> IDENTIFY YOURSELF FIRST!

From:  Michael Boyink <mike@boyink.com

In my previous corporate life I was on the web team of a Fortune 500
furniture manufacturer, selling both office and home furniture
through (at the time) 4 distinct channels.  We spent hours
struggling with the "identify yourself" issue. The company had
dealers targeting big business, dealers targeting small businesses,
retailers targeting home users, and a online store.  We used to joke
that the business model sort of collided, where all the channels had
to make sense to the site visitor in a 8 second glance on the home
page.  Pre-web this never was an issue.

The reality of the business was that each channel had its own mix of
products, services, research, sales outlets, internal support staff
and ultimately (like it or not), pricing.  In order to effectively
lead you -  as a site visitor -  down the sales path at some point
we needed to know the answer to 3 questions; what product were you
interested in, what channel would best serve you, and where were you
located.  Your path through the site determined the order in which
you "provided" the answers to those questions.

While designing the site, we were aware that many visitors would not
want to identify themselves into a channel right away.  So we
provided a path directly to a generic, all-inclusive product
showroom. By taking this path you inherently answered the product
question first, then when accessing the dealer locator from this
generic showroom you then needed to choose a channel (and the
locator had products mapped to channels, and could tell you when a
certain product wasn't available through a certain channel), and
finally a location.

For those willing to self-identify right away, other paths from the
home page led to channel-specific product showrooms.  Accessing the
dealer locator from these showrooms we already could infer the
channel and product questions, and provided location questions right
away.

Was it the most user friendly?  No, but the site had to adapt itself
to the business model.  The interesting thing is since I was laid
off from that team, 2 of the 4 channels have gone away, simplifying
both the business model and the site design.

==> IDENTIFY YOURSELF FIRST!

From:  Martha Retallick <Lrpdesigns@theriver.com>

If I'm asked to identify myself and am offered the choice of
"other," that's what I choose. Or, if I can bypass the "20
Questions" drill, I will. If I can't, then I take my business
elsewhere.

This is my way of throwing a monkey wrench into the well-laid
marketing plans of those big, database-obsessed companies that want
to extract every little nugget of information out of their customers.

==> TOPIC:  USE OF PHOTOS

From:  Deirdre' Straughan <deirdres@tiscalinet.it>

Years ago I read about a professional who was very successful in
finding business via CompuServe and well-liked by his clients, until
a picture of him was published in the CompuServe print magazine, to
illustrate a piece on CompuServe success stories. Then business
dropped off sharply. His clients hadn't realized he was
African-American, and some of them evidently had a problem with
that. A sad and discouraging illustration of (some) human nature.
Sometimes you are better off to let your words and skills speak for
you, avoiding whatever prejudices someone may bring to a photo.

We all form mental pictures of who we're dealing with, even when
these are very imaginatively based only on impressions from text and
assumptions about names. Many people in the world don't know what
sort of name Deirdre is, and in the US Adrian is a female name. So
myself and my employee Adrian, both active online, were often amused
by Americans assuming he was female, and others assuming (purely on
the basis of my technical expertise) that I was male. It became one
of the standing jokes in the company.

Funny thing, the book in which Deirdre read the anecdote about the
guy whose photo appeared in CompuServe Magazine was my 1995 book
Marketing Online, reprinted in a vastly updated edition by Maximum
Press as Internet Marketing for Less than $500/Year.
