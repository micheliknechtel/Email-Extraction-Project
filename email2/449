You might ask, what would a trace mineral have to do with the flu?  It's quite simple.  It all relates to immune function.  Researchers are learning more and more about the importance of trace minerals and other nutrients in helping to optimize cell function.  Up to thirty years ago, researchers did not even realize that selenium was an essential nutrient required for our body.  It has now been discovered that selenium is a powerful anti-oxidant that not only can help ward off a bad case of the flu, but maybe even cancer.</font></td>

</table></td><td width="60%" valign="top"><table><tr><td width="60%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"> In December 1996, JAMA published a landmark study concerning selenium.  In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of over 1,300 patients performed in the United States, it was reported that people treated with 200 mcg a day of seleno-methionine had a 37% reduction in overall cancer incidence with an astounding reduction of cancer mortality of 50%.  Prostate cancer incidence was reduced 63% in this study.  In a follow-up study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute from August 1998, 33,000 physicians were studied and it was reported that those doctors with the highest level of selenium in their blood had an approximately 66% reduction in the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer.  One might ask - with these major studies being published in reputable medical journals - why isn't mainstream medicine recommending supplemental selenium to everyone?  I wish I had an easy answer for this.  I suspect that money and politics may be playing a role.  After all, selenium is not a drug and there is no pharmaceutical company petitioning the FDA for its widespread use. In editorials published on the above noted studies, the editors commented that the results were interesting but there was not enough data to make a firm recommendation.  We contend that if the same data was available regarding a patented pharmaceutical, that the product would be fast-tracked through the FDA.<br><br>You may look at your once-a-day vitamin bottle and be pleased to see that it does include selenium.  Don't be misled by your once-a-day or so-called complete vitamins "A to zinc".  Most once-a-day vitamins contain only a small fraction (usually about 20 mcg instead of 200 mcg) of selenium and it usually the wrong form (sodium selenite, not the organic seleno-methionine).  Although selenium is a trace mineral, taken in excess it can be potentially dangerous.  Taking 200 to 600 mcg a day of the organic form of selenium should be quite safe but taking higher doses, especially of the inorganic form (sodium selenite) can cause side effects.<br><br>Also featured in this week's breaking news section, is a new study demonstrating the benefits of certain nutrients to maintain healthy blood pressure.  There are many other studies that support the benefits of calcium, magnesium and vitamin D in promoting healthy blood pressure and bones.<br><br>Many products produced by Nutraceutical Sciences Institute (NSI) contain optimal levels and forms of the above nutrients.  The best core antioxidant, vitamin, mineral and herbal products on the market are <a href="http://rd.mailshell.com/aar51ym@mailshell.com/www.vitacost.com/products/brandsaz/nsiprods/synergy2000/index.html"><b>Synergy 2000</b></a> (for men and women) and <a href="http://rd.mailshell.com/aar51ym@mailshell.com/www.vitacost.com/products/brandsaz/nsiprods/synergy3000womens/index.html"><b>Synergy 3000 Women</b></a> (adds soy and red clover isoflavones) from NSI.  These products have been reformulated several times taking into account the latest medical literature.  For example, prior to the JAMA study from 1996, Synergy 2000 contained only 100 mcg of seleno-methionine, but after that study was published, the dose was increased to the current level of 200 mcg daily.  Not only does it contain the optimal form and amount of selenium, but also contains a host of other important anti-oxidants, minerals, vitamins, herbs and phytonutrients.  Synergy 2000 costs about $1.00 per day taken in the recommended dose.  Do you consider optimal health and protection worth $1.00 a day?</font></td></tr>
