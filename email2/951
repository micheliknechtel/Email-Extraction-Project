Network Associates Buys Deersoft

SANTA CLARA -- Network Associates said Monday it has bought
Deersoft Inc. as part of a plan to add more anti-spam and
content-filtering technologies to its network-security and
anti-virus products. Network Associates, which bought McAfee.com 
in 2002, did not disclose the sale's financial terms but said it 
included Deersoft's consumer and enterprise technologies and 
customer-support service.

Fix It Fast
By Janet Roberts

I made a mistake in the previous Ezine-Tip, which will be 
corrected herein, but, oddly enough, I don't feel as bad about it 
as I should. That's because I was in good company that day. Four 
newsletter corrections came through on one day, all to fix 
mistakes that would have created problems for readers.

Today's List-A-Day Biz Review: Tradeshow Bluesletter

Is there a trade show in your future? They're fun if you're a
visitor, but they're a lot of work for the people who have to
set up the booths, make contacts and try to woo new customers
away from the scantily clad models three booths away. This 
newsletter is like a trade show in miniature: serious business 
gets done, but with fun and a little attitude.

Writers' Tip of the Week: Writing for Readers

Seems kind of obvious, doesn't it? You write with the 
expectation that somebody, somewhere, will read it. But, do you 
keep the reader in mind when you write? If you do, you'll
produce copy that's easy to read. That doesn't mean writing 
about easy topics. Anybody can understand quantum physics if 
it's explained right.
