Letter to the Editor:

Dear Penny Parenting:
My cell phone contract is about to expire. I saw an ad for the same basic
service, with another company, but $10.00 cheaper. I asked my current
company to meet that cheaper company's  price and they did, but even more
interesting is that I discovered I have been paying $5.00 per month for text
messaging. A feature I have never needed. Anyway, I was glad to keep my old
company as I could keep my old number and the savings means I will get the
equivalent of 3 free months per year!

Baby on A Budget
Many first time parents suffer from "sticker shock" when they begin
registering for baby gifts and purchasing the needed baby accessories. It's
natural to desire all of the latest gadgets and adorable clothes, but it
adds up quickly.

GUEST ARTICLE:  Five Tips to Trim your Taxes
by Naomi Knudsen, nknudsen@ameritech.net

Benjamin Franklin said,  Nothing is certain except death and taxes,  and
some would respond that at least death isn't an annual recurring event.
Here are some tips that might take the bite out of that annual recurring
event.

Tip 1.

A student or parent can claim up to a $2,500 student loan interest deduction
on their 2001 tax return if their Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is below
$40,000 for individuals and $60,000 for joint filers.  Above these amounts
the write-off is phased out.  The phase out
ranges rise significantly in 2002.

Tip 2.

Reduce your taxable income by transferring a portion of your salary into a
flexible spending account (FSA) set up by your employer.  These accounts
funded with your pretax dollars can be set up for medical expenses or
dependent care, and as you incur expenses, the fund reimburses you.

Tip 3.

A medically required diet and exercise program is deductible if it is
prescribed by a doctor to alleviate a specific medical problem such as high
blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis and even obesity.  A membership at a gym
or exercise club is deductible with the same prescription.

Tip 4:

A special break for refinancers; if you took a cash-out refinance for more
than the balance of your previous mortgage and used some of the extra money
for home improvements, you can deduct a proportionate share of the points on
your tax return.  You can also deduct the balance of any unused points from
a previous refinancing.

Tip 5:

Take the time to add up your charitable contributions, personal property
taxes, interest from your mortgage statements, real estate taxes, and state
and local taxes from your W-2 form.  If the total is more than your standard
deduction, ($7,600 for married filing jointly, $6,650 for heads of
household, $4,550 for single filers, and $3,800 for married filing
separately), you will save money on your taxes by itemizing this year. Note:
These figures are from 2001 and may change.

RECOMMENDED READING: Christopher Lowell's If You Can Dream It,
You Can Do It: Dream Decor on a Budget
by Christopher Lowell
Lowell, the host of an eponymous home decorating show on the Discovery
Channel and the author of the very successful Christopher Lowell's Seven
Layers of Design, has a vivacious, flamboyant persona that's garnered him a
considerable squadron of fans. His forte: inspiration on the psychological
side, and re-design on the physical. Taking a room in a modest house or
apartment, for example, he applies a theme ("Theater Living," say, or
"Zen-sational Office") to liven it up; "every dream, like every good room,"
he writes, "needs a theme."
