               I Love You Anyway
               By Dr. Joe Harding

     It was Friday morning and a young businessman finally 
decided to ask his boss for a raise.  Before leaving for 
work, he told his wife what he was about to do.  All day 
long he felt nervous and apprehensive.  Finally, in the 
late afternoon, he summoned the courage to approach his 
employer, and to his delight, the boss agreed to the raise.
     The elated husband arrived home to a beautiful table 
set with their best china and lighted candles.  Smelling 
the aroma of a festive meal, he figured that someone from 
the office had called his wife and tipped her off.  Finding 
her in the kitchen, he eagerly shared the details of his 
good news.  They embraced and danced around the room before 
sitting down to the wonderful meal his wife had prepared.  
Next to his plate he found an artistically lettered note 
that read, "Congratulations, darling!  I knew you'd get the 
raise!  This dinner is to show you how much I love you."
     Later on his way to the kitchen to help his wife serve 
dessert, he noticed that a second card had fallen from her 
pocket.  Picking it up off the floor, he read, "Don't worry 
about not getting the raise!  You deserve it anyway!  This 
dinner is to show how much I love you."
