What You Need To Know About House &amp; Home
 From Philip Powell, your Editor and Guide

 --------------------------- EDITOR'S NOTE ----------------------------
 Not satisfied with stock designs in homes and apartments, I've spent (or wasted) many hours sketching plans and ideas for my dream house. Never gave a thought to the difficulties involved, nor the cost. Still, dreaming is free and when it comes to house and home, we all indulge in a little fantasizing now and then.

 Building the Dream: Your Own Home

 -Architecture Guide Jackie Craven
 Who hasn't dreamed of building your own home? Everything the way you want it, your very own style, no compromises. Sounds ideal and in most respects it is, but house building is also full of potential pitfalls. Here's an article to help you live the dream while avoiding those legal and financial disasters.

 Save Money, Gain a Friend: Get a Roommate

 -Apartment Living/Rental Guide Sandra Clockedile
 For many apartment dwellers a roommate means money saved (or maybe a better apartment); help with the housework; a friend to hang out with. Choosing the wrong person can, unfortunately, lead to disputes and unhappiness. So before you place that ad, check this helpful feature on the pros and cons of sharing space.

 Condiment, Salt and Pepper Shakers from your Entertaining Guide
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/BCA
 Those old-fashioned restaurant salt and pepper shakers may have been practical, but they sure weren't pretty. Our Guide has uncovered a selection of shakers and condiment holders handsome enough to make every table setting a feast for the eyes.
 1. Oil, Vinegar, Salt and Pepper Tray
 Sleek, modern, and functional, this condiment caddy suits a contemporary lifestyle. It can make fish and chips, or even a simple salad, look like a meal fit for royalty.
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/BC7
 2. Condiment Squeeze Bottles
 Classic squeeze bottles right out of a retro roadside diner. The set of three can be used for ketchup, mustard, mayonaisse, or salad dressing, and they look great alongside those restaurant-style shakers I mentioned a moment ago. Add a little whimsy to your table!

 3. Perfex Salt and Pepper Mills
 As any good chef knows, for the best in flavor you should grind it fresh. Here's a handsome, contemporary set of grinders that will add grace to your table even as they add taste to the food.
