Subject: KHV Testing By Retailers & New Articles

Greetings for February from KoiVet.com

I suppose many of you have heard that KHV has temporarily side-lined one =
of the biggest names in the Koi retail and wholesale industry. Additional=
ly, KHV was found in some fish from perhaps the biggest online Koi biddin=
g web site as well.=20

These situations illustrate that the problems with KHV aren=92t going to =
go away by themselves. Knowledge is power.=20

I=92ve written some things which are by no means definitive, but they=92r=
e pretty much =93as far as I know=94 type articles.=20

An article that attempts to bring some perspective to KHV and SVC issues:=
=20
http://www.koivet.com/html/articles/articles_details.php?article_id=3D196=


Since heating fish that are affected by KHV seems to increase their survi=
val rates the most, I gave more detail about heating fish from =93cold=94=
 to =93warm=94, in the following article:=20
http://www.koivet.com/html/articles/articles_details.php?article_id=3D197=


KHV is probably going to be a major player in the hobby this year. Since =
heating the fish may make the MOST difference to the survival of the fish=
, early detection is crucial! This is because IF the fish suffer enough g=
ill and internal-organ damage, they will not survive regardless of what o=
ne might try to do.=20

Finally, we=92re seeing changes in the industry. Two koi retailers are te=
sting ROUTINELY  for KHV and even posting their results! Emily Ragland fr=
om KoiConnection.com and Robert Bongiorno of Suburban Water Gardens (Subu=
rbanponds.com) are both engaging veterinary services through the Universi=
ty of Georgia in a regular testing protocol so that early detection is po=
ssible.=20

It=92s probable that most of the other Koi dealers will come on board usi=
ng their own veterinary talent and labs, using routine testing protocols =
to remain competitive.=20

Routine testing, driven by commercial pressure to compete, will probably =
enhance our understanding of the prevalence of this disease, and aid in i=
ts control.=20

Past that, there=92s not much new to report. Basically, so far as the vir=
uses are concerned, it boils down to awareness and then the fastest disse=
mination of the information that seems to make the most difference to fis=
h survival, and so far, heating seems to be =93it=94.=20

Thank you for your time.=20

Dr. Erik Johnson
