"Getting Down and Dirty With the Cast of Narc"
By Teddy Durgin
tedfilm@aol.com

Jason Patric and Ray Liotta are as different from each other
in real life as their characters, Nick Tellis and Henry Oak,
are in the new movie, "Narc" (expanding from six screens to
around 800 or so this coming weekend).  I know from
firsthand experience, having had the pleasure of
interviewing both actors in New York a few weeks ago.

Like Nick Tellis, the wounded narcotics detective fighting
back from addiction to reclaim his job on the Detroit police
force, Patric is quiet, thoughtful, and introspective.  A
consummate artist, he's still finding his way in an industry
that requires other people's approval just for him to work.
That frustrates the young professional, who has fought hard
to advance from '80s teen idol in "The Lost Boys" to tabloid
fodder in the early '90s as Julia Roberts' boyfriend to one
of the more interesting and unique screen presences working
in film today.

Patric, who has starred in such highly regarded indies as
"Rush" and "Your Friends and Neighbors," said, "I have a
non-career in the Hollywood scheme of things.  I've done the
opposite of the book.  I never have another movie filming
when one is in the can.  I haven't done filler movies where
the role is good, but I knew the movie was bad, just to keep
my face and name out there.  ... I've made two movies in the
last five years--'Your Friends and Neighbors' and
'Narc'--and I'm happy with them."

Liotta, by contrast, burst on the scene in such memorable
'80s films as "Something Wild," "Dominick and Eugene," and
"Field of Dreams."  His career has had its ups
("GoodFellas") and downs ("Turbulence") since, but the last
couple of years has seen the actor turn up in more and more
diverse movies such as "Hannibal," "Blow," and "John Q."

Liotta was the one who actually found "Narc," bought the
rights to it with his wife, and gave first-time
writer-director Joe Carnahan a shot to lense his own script.
  Liotta stated, "I just wanted to get a little more
proactive with my career.  In terms of some of the parts I
was getting, I wasn't crazy about [any of them].  I changed
agencies.  I wanted to produce my own things, and this is
the first movie I read and I just really responded to it.
'Narc' reminded me very much of a '70s movie about an
anti-hero.  The movies I grew up on when I started acting
were in the '70s where my idols were Robert Duvall and
Hackman and Pacino and DeNiro.  Those were anti-heroes.
They were the leads of the movies who weren't all dressed in
white.  There was a lot of gray in what they did and who
they were."

It was Carnahan who had the idea to cast the very different
Patric opposite him.  In the film, Liotta places an intense,
strangely secretive police detective, eager to get to the
bottom of who killed his former partner.  Patric is the new
guy, assigned to spearhead the case.  Liotta is the
supporting performer in the film, but he has the showier
part.

Liotta remarked, "His energy is very different than mine.
He is very cerebral.  He thinks things out a lot.  He keeps
to himself, and my character is just extremely wound-up.
What was good about [the pairing] was Jason is mature.  With
other actors, they might be afraid that my character might
be upstaging them, if you will.  He knew what his part was.
So, when I'm yelling at him in the film, he knows he can
only go to a certain degree because he knows I'm a live
wire.  When he yells at me 'Get your hands outta my face,'
he does it in such a way where a lesser actor would want to
show off that he could be tough, too.  And it doesn't make
sense, because my guy would never have lost and never would
have been talked to in a certain way.  And Jason knew the
level of where his character should be without competing
with the intensity of my character."

Talking with Liotta, I was struck by how much of a physical
transformation he underwent to bring Oak vividly to life on
screen.  In real life, the guy still has those intense,
piercing blue eyes, but he is about as slim as they come.
In "Narc," he hulks over everyone else in the cast.  He's a
brute and a bruiser, a suspect abuser ... and you can't take
your eyes off of him.

"The script said Oak had a 93 percent conviction rate,"
explained Liotta, who put on 25 lbs. for the role.  "That's
a really dedicated person.  So I just didn't think that he
was the kind of guy that after chasing down the bad guys, he
went home and made a salad.  He just seemed more like
someone I thought was fast-food, pizzas, burgers, whatever.
I used a lot of makeup under my eyes to show a tired, worn,
lived-in look.  I shaved my hair back.  I used different
parts of my wardrobe, different things you can add like
shoulder pads.  I wore lifts, because one thing Joe wrote in
the script was that Oak was big and bruising.  He would
write things like: 'Oak towered over the suspects.'  It just
all seemed right for the character."

Patric, meanwhile, looked to find his character from the
inside out.  His main goal was to make "Narc" both similar
to other great cop films, yet different in a way that would
give the movie its own distinct vibe and payoff.  "When you
are doing a genre film," he told me, "you try and find
elements--not just style elements, but literally pictures
that remain in your mind.  Joe had it written that he wanted
me to shower with a baby, my child in the film.  I said,
'Great.'  And my suggestion was we start on my face, so you
just see Tellis thinking about what we have just seen in the
scene before that, and then we reveal the baby.  Then, it
becomes a scene, and there's movement to it and you form the
character without dialogue."

Patric is notoriously outspoken about his own films and
about other movies he perceives to be of lesser quality.  He
doesn't suffer fools lightly.  You gotta be on your toes
when you talk to Jason Patric, because he will shoot you
down if you ask a less-than-intelligent question.  I
actually found his candor refreshing.  When asked about his
role in the 1997 bomb, "Speed 2: Cruise Control," for
instance, he responded, "I'd been offered a lot of action
movies and didn't do them.  They're all sequels, in my
opinion.  That was the one that was told to me, and
pressured me, that it seemed to be fool-proof.  The
director's [Jan DeBont of 'Speed' and 'Twister' fame] first
two movies made $1 billion.  They had a built-in audience.
They wanted me not for my box office.  They obviously wanted
me for some form of acting that I was not able to do then."

So, will he never do another mainstream Hollywood film?
"I'd do it if I found something worthwhile," he replied.
"I'm not genre-specific.  Would I do a romantic comedy?
Yeah, if it was good.  If it was smart.  If it was what
Woody Allen used to be able to do.  I like 'Animal House.'
It's a well-made movie for that genre, and 'American Pie' is
not.  That's the difference in the way movies are made.
It's not that I'm 'Serious Drama Man.'  I'm trying to find
real behavior.  I want to find real things."

What he and Liotta eventually found was "Narc," which takes
the gritty realism of the big-screen police procedural genre
to new heights (or depths, depending on how you want to look
at it ... the film is gritty, gritty, gritty).  "Narc" has
scored major integrity points on the Tinseltown circuit,
too.  Shot in Toronto in 28 days on a budget of just $5
million, the film was discovered at the Sundance Film
Festival earlier this year by Tom Cruise and his longtime
producer pal, Paula Wagner, who brought it to Paramount.

The production had been a troubled one, though, with
Carnahan and crew having constantly run up against budgetary
constraints.  It became necessary to hit friends and
industry acquaintances up for money, trading producer
credits for cash.  Liotta recalled, "We never saw dailies,
because we could never pay the lab.  So, Joe never got to
see dailies.  Here's this second movie he's ever
made--really his first full-blown film.  It was hand-held.
I asked him, 'How do you wanna make the movie?'  He said he
wanted to shoot it like 'French Connection,' in terms of the
language, the violence, what happens on the street.  And do
it in a Cassavettes-type style.  Hand-held, natural
lighting.  But because the camera moved so much, we never
knew if stuff was even in focus half the time.  Three months
after we finished, we still never saw dailies because we
never got paid!"

The artistic and emotional payoff, though, is quite
remarkable.  I put "Narc quite high on my 10 Best list for
2002, comparing it to such great '70s cop films as "The
French Connection" and "Serpico," as well as to TV's
"Homicide: Life on the Street."  It succeeds on nearly every
level, largely due to the talents and chemistry of Patric
and Liotta.  Of the two performers, Liotta seems a lock for
an Oscar nomination.  Late in the film, he has a remarkable
and exhausting interrogation of two hand-cuffed suspects,
one of whom is played by rap artist Busta Rhymes, who I also
got to hang out with briefly while in New York.

Up close, Rhymes was amazed at the actor's intensity
especially when the climactic scene spilled over into
violence.  He recalled, "There were a couple of times where
we had to tell Ray [whispering], 'Easy over there.  You're
slapping me in the head a little too hard.  You're pulling
my hair a little too rough.'  When he gets into character,
he's outta control!  Seriously, he's crazy.  But he was
inspiring to me.  That's the kinda stuff I wanna soak in,
know what I'm saying?  It takes Ray a minute to wind down,
even after the director says, 'Cut!'  Sometimes, because he
didn't wanna wind down, Ray wanted to get two or three takes
in while he was in that zone.  He would be doing these
lines, and he's so into the character, that he's screaming
at somebody, 'Gimme the next line!  Come on!  Come on!
Gimme the next line!'  And he's stuttering until you throw
the line at him.  That adrenaline is just crazy while he's
in that zone.  I loved it!"

"Narc" is rated R for violence, language, and drug use.

CORRECTION: In my review of "About Schmidt" last week, I
incorrectly listed the film's rating as PG-13.  It's
actually rated R ... a very mild R, folks.
