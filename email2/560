Many of you receive our Visitors Network newsletters for PA, NY and/or NJ=
 as we release them quarterly.
Just wanted to stray from that habit very briefly to introduce our newest=
 site - the Connecticut Visitors Network.  As usual, the Internet Superhi=
ghway is always under construction... and you'll see that with our Connec=
ticut site.
Just take a look and watch as we expand into the other 5 New England Stat=
es in 2003.
Visit Connecticut at http://www.connecticutvisitorsnetwork.com

Thanks for allowing me to briefly intrude on your day.

Bill Hall, CEO
Visitors Network
