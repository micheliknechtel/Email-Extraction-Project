I-Entrepreneur Issue 043
----------------------

==> THREE SIMPLE OBJECTIVES

I thought the following phrase that appeared in I-Entrepreneur
would be a great way to start of the Adventive Report for 2003:

It's been supplied by the moderator, Mark Neeley:

------------------

For many businesses, January and February are quiet times, as work
slows while key clients are on vacation.

It is an opportune time, then, to reflect back on the highs and lows
of the previous year, divine any lessons to be learnt and devise
strategies for the year ahead.

In addition to doing the "big picture" thinking - detecting business
and market trends and the opportunities they create - it is also a
great opportunity to look internally and assess whether there are
any aspects of your business that you could be doing better.

(Ideally, we'd have the time to do this on an on-going basis, but
alas...)

A simple phrase - IT BECAME FASTEST - offers a handy mental "cheat
sheet" for doing internal reviews:

(I)mprove basic efficiency - all the time.
(T)hink as simply and directly as possible about what you're doing
and why.

(B)ehave towards others as you wish them to behave towards you.
(E)valuate each business and business opportunity with all the
objective facts and logic you can muster.
(C)oncentrate on what you do well.
(A)sk questions ceaselessly about your performance, your markets,
your objectives.
(M)ake money; if you don't, you don't do anything else.
(E)conomise, because doing the most with the least is the name of
the game.

(F)latten the company, so authority is spread over many people.
(A)dmit to your failings and shortcomings, because only then will
you be able to improve on them.
(S)hare the benefits of success widely amongst those who helped you
to achieve it.
(T)ighten up the organisation whenever you can - because success
tends to breed slackness.
(E)nable everybody in the business to use their individual powers to
the fullest possible extent.
(S)erve your customers with all their requirements and desires to
standards of perceived excellence in quality.
(T)ransform performance by constantly innovating in products and
processes - including the ways in which the business is managed.

(Source: _Goldfinger: How Entrepreneurs Grow Rich by Starting
Small_, R. Heller)

Some entrepreneurs eschew such "cutesy" lists, figuring that if the
process of creating wealth can be reduced to a handful of simple
rules, then there'd be a lot more wealthy individuals than there
currently is today.

They're wrong. Running a successful business is not "rocket
science". Most of the time it requires little more than common
sense. As I've mentioned in past issues, however, common sense is
somewhat uncommon!

Making your business more successful in 2003 requires that you focus
on three simple objectives:

1. Increase sales.
2. Decrease overheads (by reducing costs and improving efficiency).
3. Increase profit margins.

Forget fads. Ignore the utterings of charismatic CEOs and
I-Will-Make-You-Rich evangelists. Before each and every decision you
make, or action you carry out, ask yourself which of these three
objectives it meets. If it doesn't meet any of them, don't waste
your time - do something that does.

------------------------

The three objectives sound simple enough.
Do you have any additional comments?

I-Copywriting, Issue 082
------------------------

===> TOPIC: DO YOU HAVE A PLAN?

Along the same vein as the thread above, I-Copywriting moderator,
Nick Usborne, asked his subscribers:

>> Do you plan your year ahead? If you are freelancing, do you make
yourself promises about what kind of work you'll look for this year?
Do you have a 'plan'? <<

We could apply these questions to any aspect of business so I've
included some of the responses below.

-------------------------------------

At the risk of rendering fellow UK-based I-CDers helpless with
laughter, I think there's a lot for us freelance writers to learn
from showbiz artists like Madonna and Geri Halliwell (formerly
Ginger Spice).

Not only do they have "plans" but also periodically they reinvent
themselves.  I know Geri Halliwell seems to have lost sight of what
it was she was supposed to be reinventing.  But you can't fail to
admire the way Madonna has kept reworking herself and her material
and coming up with fresh styles, approaches and genres.

Like the rest of us she hatches the occasional turkey, but she
quickly wrings its neck and moves on to the next golden goose egg.

Not that she jumps from singing to needlepoint to paleontology, of
course.  She sticks to what she's good at - her core talents. But
she uses her entrepreneurial skill and creativity to develop her
core talents in various appropriate guises so that she's got some
fresh, tasty produce for each new wave of music consumers that
appears in the marketplace.

Freelance writers who have been around for more than ten minutes,
(like me) need, IMHO, to do the same if they want to stay in
business.

Yet over here in UK, at least, I often bump into colleagues and
competitors - usually whining about declining business and bad
payers - who are doing the same stuff they've been doing for the
past 5, 10, 15 or even 20 years.  When challenged they say it's
better to stick to what they're good at and not risk starting at the
bottom with some new areas of business.  "Yes," I grunt, "but what
you're good at is writing, not just ad copy or PR or speeches or
direct response.  No-one's asking you to learn a new skill, just a
new manifestation of it."

So, I think one of the most effective "plans" a freelance writer can
have is one that embraces periodic reinvention, ensuring that your
skills and talents are flexible enough to be deployed for whatever
your market needs - or is about to need.

And that mustn't be regarded as a knee jerk job, reacting to
shrivelling demand.  As Sir James Goldsmith, a famous British
entrepreneur, once said, "If you can *see* a bandwagon, it's too
late."

The trick with successful reinvention, as demonstrated by Madonna,
is to do it sooner rather than later and include the reinvention
concept in your long term business plan.  After all, the balance of
your portfolio of skills and experience will vary according to what
stage you're at in your career.  So to me it makes sense to plumb
that into the system as a positive asset, not shut it into the
closet as some vaguely threatening unknown variable.

Alan Forrest Smith wrote in with some simple tips:

--------------------

My plans are this and am more convinced daily of it.

#. Only accept work I am happy to do and believe in.
#. Fire clients if they drive me nuts.
#. Chase clients I want as clients (watch out).
#. Charge accordingly to support me, wife 4 kids, dog a cat and
everything else my life entails.(most copywriters are far too cheap)
#.Charge according to the time, effort and quality of my work.
#. Become the best at my work.(haughty I know but I believe it)
#. Increase my writing partners.(the best need only apply ;-)
#. Totally ignore the rules of "most" copywriters.
#. Increase my performance daily.
#. Read more, more, more and a little bit... more.

2002 has been an amazing year for http://www.orangebeetle.com ...
Bottom line, more of the same but grow, grow, grow.

Martha Retallick supplied some personal goals:

--------------------

1. Research, write and publish an e-book to accompany my postcard
marketing e-book. Look for it this summer.

2. Create written business procedures manuals for each of my two
hats, web design and electronic (read: e-book) publishing.
Rationale: If I don't have a handle on what I'm doing in business,
then I'll waste a lot of time, and not the make the amount of money
that I'd like to earn.

3. Create a business plan for my e-book publishing business. Yup,
this will involve writing as well.

4. I will continue to grow as a copywriter by studying books written
by the "best of the best." On the plane back to Tucson, I started
reading Richard Hodgson's classic, The Greatest Direct Mail Sales
Letters of All Time.

My business plan for 2003 is to focus on just two or three types of
projects. I hope that by streamlining my work, I can become more of
a specialist, move into a higher pay range, and manage my time
better. This may be a bit of a pipe dream, but so was full-time
freelancing in the first place...until I achieved it. I'm going to
give it a go. I'll let you know how it turns out.

In the meantime, anybody have any personal experiences with becoming
a specialist or streamlining as I've described? I'd love some
pointers.

I-Design, Issue 331
------------------------

===> TOPIC: HELP NEEDED WITH COPY PROTECTION

Catherine Parvensky Barwell asked for some help in I-Design that
again, applies to all Internet businesses. Has this happened to you?

-----------------------------

I have been having a problem with people copying one of my websites
(www.grocerybiz.info). In one case, the individual actually stole
the entire 100+ page site, downloaded it into a database and was
prepared to sell replicated sites to others. I have the site right
click protected, but this does not prevent someone from selecting
"save as" from the file menu, nor does it prevent someone from
saving pages from Adobe Acrobat (which has also happened). I have
taken appropriate action against the copyright infringers, but I
would like to prevent this from happening yet again in the future.

Does anyone know how to adequately protect an entire site from being
copied?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

---------------------------

There's been only one response so far from Kim Krause:

---------------------------

For Catherine, regarding copied websites, I've found this site,
http://www.pirated-sites.com/ , to be interesting. Be sure to check
out their FAQ. Also, I tried to gather a lot of resources into one
place here: http://www.cre8pc.com/scam_protectsite.html

Do you have any suggestions for Catherine?
