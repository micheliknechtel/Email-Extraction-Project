IMDb MOVIE OF THE DAY

What's with Peter Jackson's love affair with matricide? In the years
before Frodo, his characters offed their mothers with gory gusto. The
most whirling depiction of the act occurs in his third film, Brain Dead
(known as Dead Alive in the U.S.). Jackson splendidly recreates a 1957
New Zealand village, where love is blooming between Lionel (Timothy
Balme), a consummate mama's boy, and local shopgirl Paquita (Diana
Pe=F1alver). Lionel's overbearing mum (Elizabeth Moody) doesn't approve =
of
the romance, and follows the couple on their first date: a trip to the
zoo. It turns out to be quite a bad idea, as a zoologist has smuggled a
rat monkey into said zoo, which bites Lionel's mother after she taunts
the beast. The bite turns her into a zombie -- one that craves brains,
naturally (as Jackson is an admitted disciple of George Romero).
Determined to preserve his mum and his romance, Lionel locks her - and
the others she's bitten, including the village's horny priest - in the
basement. But soon Lionel=92s Uncle Les (Ian Watkin) comes calling,
discovers the scene, and lays claim to the house and mum=92s money. To
celebrate, Les throws a huge party at the house...which can only spell
trouble. Certainly no stranger to the horror-comedy genre, Jackson had a
big budget ($3 million, his largest at the time) to work with, as well
as his trusty puppeteer, Ramon Aguilar, who worked on the director's
shockingly gross Meet the Feebles. This allowed the director to create a
mother of finales, the showdown between Lionel, what used to be his
beloved mum, and a house full of zombies. It's a scene so uncivilized
that several versions of the film exist on video, even different unrated
versions. It's also a chance to see how one of today's premiere
directors made bathtub gin before he started sipping Bombay Sapphire.=20
