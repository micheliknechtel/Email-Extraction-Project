1. Web Site Renovation
------------------------------------------------------------
The web site has been renovated! A lot of the content is the 
same, but it looks cleaner, more professional. I've 
also added a lot of projects that I hadn't gotten around 
to posting (there are  more to come), and there is much 
more information about sound system design, my sound-system 
designer, Jack Covert, and projects. Check it out, and let me
know what you think: www.orpheus-acoustics.com. 

2. Late Makes Waste
------------------------------------------------------------
Acoustics is determined by large fundamental aspects of a
design, such as the budget, locations of noisy  equipment, 
and the form of the room. For this reason, it is 
imperative to consider acoustics right from the very beginning 
of design--before pencil meets paper. This is really the only
way to get your money's worth from an acoustical consultant.

I just came back from meeting with a group of people about 
their new church. The new sanctuary is nearly 10 times larger 
than the old sanctuary. The new church is well under construction. 

Music is fundamental to the  worship of this congregation. 
They are going to have a 100-voice choir, instruments, solo 
piano. Yet, it is perfectly clear that acoustics was never 
once considered during the design. One example will make 
this abundantly clear: HVAC units are located directly 
above the sound booth. Did I say "sound booth"?

No one thought to put the people who control the
sound system in the congregation, where they
will be able to hear what the congregation hears. And
then to place noise machinery on top?---I am at
a loss for words.

So, this congregation is spending millions of their 
hard-earned dollars to build a church that will stand
for, say, a hundred years or so. Music is central
to their worship--and the architect did not consider the
acoustics of their sanctuary for a moment. I think that
is a crime.


3. The Book
------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a quote from an e-mail from a colleague on the book:

"Very well done!! Informative, revealing, and thought 
provoking. The book is a must read for anyone considering 
being involved with schools, theaters, and any listening space.  
I wish every school board member would read it!!"
