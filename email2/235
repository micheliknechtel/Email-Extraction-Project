Making Money Filtering E-Mail
In the past year, spam has become an unfortunate fact of corporate 
e-mail life. "No one doesn't have a spam problem anymore," says Tony 
Comazzi, vice president of messaging solutions at the Newman Group, a 
Dexter, Mich.-based VAR. "If someone says they don't have a spam 
problem, they are doing something magical,or else they are lying."
