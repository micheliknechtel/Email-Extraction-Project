Hope you had a happy holidays. I have been making some 
small changes and been busy getting everything in order & 
working the kinks out. Please note that I have a new email 
address, most mail to the old address is not getting through 
though it is supposed to be getting forwarded. I switched to 
a cable modem and had problems getting a strong enough 
signal, but the techs seem to have it working fine now. My 
new email address is awv@ndsupernet.com

action towards its achievement."
