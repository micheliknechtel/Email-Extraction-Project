Guarantees Mean Unethical Search Engine Optimization
               by Mike Banks Valentine

Guarantees are being offered much less often by Search
Engine Optimizers to retain clients, but as long as there
are aggressive and rapacious customers, there will be an
SEO to accept work by offering guarantees in a category
that can never be [honestly] dominated using generic and
popular search phrases.

SEO experts can not "guarantee" a placement in the top ten
for any keywords on any of the search engines. This is simply
a marketing ploy used by unethical SEO's to get work. None
of the [honest] best would ever take on a client who insists
on being number one for common two word phrases. Everyone
should know by now that results come only from honest page
content, link popularity and proper use of targeted terms.

THE proven method of ranking well in your desired search
phrases is simply to provide great content with appropriate
page architecture in a category that is not already
dominated by cheaters doing keyword stuffing and using
other unethical techniques to gain top positions.

Take a look at the source code of the following page and
judge it for yourself on value to the searcher and then
tell me why it ranks number two for Los Angeles Personal
Injury Attorney and whether you believe it deserves that
position when the page has NO VISIBLE TEXT, only an
embedded flash movie and a sliced image! [Hint, place
your cursor in the lower right hand corner of the black
background at the bottom of the page and drag your mouse
upwards to select the invisible text]

Invisible text keyword stuffing is not acceptable at
one single search engine and most will ban those who
insist on using the technique, but not until they find
out that it is happening. Perhaps that is why more of
the top search engines are offering methods of reporting
the use of unethical techniques through their own sites.

Here's the address to report this behavior at Google.

http://www.google.com/contact/spamreport.html

That is given from the 'Information for Webmasters page

http://www.google.com/webmasters/seo.html

The second bullet point on this page will tell you that

"No one can guarantee a #1 ranking on Google"

I recently turned down an attorney client for SEO who
wanted to dominate the search engines for the term Los
Angeles Attorney and appear within the top ten results
for that single search phrase after some basic research
where I found several cheating competitors for the terms
he should be targeting legitimately.

Perhaps Google hasn't discovered them yet? I just can't
see myself playing ethics cop to SEO firms that offer
top results when their techniques could get the client
banned from many search engines.

If you go to Google and search the phrase Los Angeles
Attorney, you'll find that the number one and two
positions are held by http://da.co.la.ca.us/ the LA
District Attorney's Office web site. Number 3 position
is held by the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office.

This is not unusual for any term that could apply to a
government web site, as they often properly structure
their pages, avoid using stupid techniques like keyword
stuffing and provide tons of useful TEXT based content.
This is also very likely due to the link popularity of
the LA DA site with 954 links pointing to them, followed
by proper page architecture of using Los Angeles Attorney
in the most important place on the page -- the TITLE TAG.

The Title tag is ignored by the vast majority of amateur
optimizers. Then, appropriate and intelligent use of the
search term in the metatags, use of the targeted search
phrase in the body text, and finally, many pages of useful,
text-filled content that is RELEVANT to the search phrase!

I recommended to that potential attorney client that he
more tightly target his search phrase at his specialty,
which I won't disclose here. That technique is what I
insist on with all clients who want to rank in the top
ten, but I still won't guarantee the position, but simply
suggest that it would better serve them to have a top
position in their specialty rather than using generic
search terms and resorting to trickery.

Beware fast talking salesmen and unsolicited phone calls.
NEVER Believe in Search Engine position guarantees!
