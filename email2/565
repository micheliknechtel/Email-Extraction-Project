A missionary visited a small village in a remote jungle and began 
preaching the gospel. 

"Jesus saves!" exclaimed the missionalry. "Bawana!" shouted the natives. 


"Ye must be baptized!" exclaimed the missionary. "Bawana!" shouted the 
natives 

"Donate tithes and offerings!" exclaimed the missionary. "Bawana!" 
shouted the natives. 

Having had such a successful time, the missionary inquired of the chief 
as to how he could go to the next village, to share the gospel with them 
too. 

The chief replied, "You go down road one thousand paces, you turn right, 
climb over wall made of rocks, run across field. Many bulls in field, 
you run fast, but be careful not step in bawana."

A police officer pulls over this guy who had been weaving in and out of 
the lanes. He goes up to the guy's window and says "Sir, I need you to 
blow into this breathalyzer tube." 

The man says, "Sorry officer I can't do that. I am an asthmatic. If I do 
that I'll have a really bad asthma attack." 

"Okay, fine. I need you to come down to the station to give a blood 
sample." 

I can't do that either. I am a hemophiliac. If I do that, I'll bleed to 
death." 

"Well, then we need a urine sample."

that I'll get really low blood sugar."

"Daddy, where did I come from?" the seven-year-old asked. 

It was a moment for which her parents had carefully prepared. They took 
her into the living room, got out the encyclopedia and several other 
books, and explained all they thought she should know about sexual 
attraction, affection, love, and reproduction. Then they both sat back 
and smiled contentedly. 

"Does that answer your question?' her father asked. 

"Not really," the little girl said. "Judy said she came from Detroit. I 
want to know where I came from."
