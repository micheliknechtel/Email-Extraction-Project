- Small plane hijacker scares Frankfurt

Frankfurt am Main. The hijacking of a small plane in Frankfurt ended
without incident. The hijacker, young man presumed to be emotionally
disturbed, flew around Frankfurt for around two hours before landing the
plane at Frankfurt airport. The police arrested him immediately. The man
had threatened that he would fly into one of the skyscrapers in the city
center; the police thus blocked all traffic in the area and evacuated
several buildings. Airforce Phantom fighter jets tracked the aeroplane.
The hijacker is currently being questioned, however the police do not
think that he is a terrorist. The man had already said, while in the
aeroplane, that he wanted to remember the female astronaut who died in
the crash of the shuttle Challenger in 1986. He said that had not
intended to hurt anyone but that he had wanted to kill himself after the
flight.


- Lufthansa plan in emergency landing after bomb threat

Chicago. A full Lufthansa passenger jet had to make an unplanned landing
in Chicago after having received a false bomb threat. The plane was
en-route from Frankfurt to Mexico City when the bomb threat was received
via telephone. The pilot immediately diverted to the nearest airport,
Chicago O'Hare, but no bomb could be found. The 392 passengers were able
to continue their journey in the evening.


- Floods still a threat

Wertheim. The floods of the last few days have caused less damage than
originally feared. Although the weather situation has improved, the
authorities say that further flooding could still occur. Particularly
critical areas are Wertheim in Baden Wuertemburg and Leuibingen in
Thuringia. The old inner city in Cologne was not flooded, as was the case
in many other cities and towns along the Rhine and the Mosel rivers. A
young boy was drowned in Sachsen Anhalt when he fell into the River Ilse.
The four-year old apparently wanted to play in the water.



- Arbitration for public service wage negotiations

Bremen. The arbitration process for the public service wage negotiations
is apparently going to fail, according to reports. Negotiators in Bremen
say that a last-minute compromise is just as likely as the arbitration
failing completely. The union for public servants, ver.di, has threatened
long strikes should the arbitration process not be successful. The union
is demanding a wage increase of at least 3 percent, whereas the employers
have only offered two percent in two stages and have rejected the
arbitrator's proposal. More details were not released.


- Doering's position confirmed

Stuttgart. The head of the FDP in Baden Wuertemburg, Mr. Doering, has had
his appointment confirmed. Seventy seven percent of the delegates voted
for him at the state party meeting in Stuttgart. Mr. Doering received 20
percent more votes two years ago.  The decrease in support is probably
due to Mr. Doering's statements that the current state of the FDP's is
more dramatic than most of the party leaders want to admit to. Mr.
Doering however supported party head, Guido Westerwelle, in Stuttgart and
called for the FDP to make a new beginning.


- Schmidt is considering increasing child subsidy

Berlin. Ms Schmidt, Federal Minister of Health, is planning to increase
state child subsidies for low-income families. This was confirmed by one
of her spokesmen in Berlin. It is planned that this so-called second
stage of the subsidy be increased to the amount received for social
welfare plus a set sum for purchases such as prams or clothes. The
financing of the program is going to be discussed as part of the reform
for the financing of municipalities. According to the newspaper "BILD",
Ms. Schmidt is also planning to investigate the quality of medicine and
medical treatment. Furthermore, a type of "Health Passport" is planned to
prevent frequent changing of doctors and unnecessary multiple medical
examinations. The Minister is hoping that this will enable savings of up
to 8.4 billion Euros.



- Ice and snow in South-West Germany

There were many car accidents in many parts of Stuttgart on Sunday
morning due to icy roads, in particular along the A8 and A81 motor ways
as well as the national roads 14 and 27. The A8 had to be closed between
Heimsheim and Leonberg due to the number of accidents in the area.
Overturned trees on the A5 between Karlsruhe and Basel blocked traffic in
Ettenheim and Herbolzheim. There were chaotic traffic conditions in parts
of Westphalia already on Saturday evening where it had snowed heavily.
More than 300 cars were blocked on the  A6 at Mannheim by a lorry which
had skidded across the motorway.
