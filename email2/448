This has happened to me not once, but twice in the last few days.  In a recent article published in the April 18 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers questioned the efficacy of St. John's Wort in the treatment of major depression.  In the study conducted in 200 adults with depression, it was found that St. John's extract had no benefit as compared to placebo.  According to the Reuters article, the researchers concluded that until more well designed trials are completed, there is currently no credible evidence to support the efficacy of St. John's Wort for people with depression.  So why do I want to scream?<br><br>Firstly, this study was done with patients who had major depression for over two years in contrast to the millions of people in this country and throughout the world who suffer with mild to moderate depression of a more short-term nature.  No reputable person in the nutrition industry every suggested St. John's Wort be used alone for the treatment of major depression.</font></td><td width="1" bgcolor="black"></td><td width="50%" align="center"><img src="http://www.vitacost.com/indximages/bottle.jpg" border="0"><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><strong>Vitacost.com carries a full line of St. John's Wort from a variety of manufacturers.

Pfizer manufactures and sells Zoloft, an antidepressant medication with sales in the multi-billions of dollars per year.  Now talk about a conflict of interest!  I am sure Pfizer does not want an effective, inexpensive and safe herb displacing their drug.<br><br>The second item worth screaming about concerns an advertisement seen on CNN Headline News recently.  The ad, sponsored by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, features an individual who underwent hip replacement reporting that he was now "perfect."  Nowhere in the advertisement was there any discussion about any potential risks (including death) from such a procedure along with the fact that many people who have hip replacements are subsequently not "perfect".<br><br>Is there mention about any other options to this procedure?  Certainly not in this ad.  Could the fact that doctors and hospitals are paid tens of thousands of dollars for surgery play in a role in their decision to push surgery over natural medicine options?  There are millions of people taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) every year prior to undergoing hip and knee replacements and no one seems to emphasize the complications and dangers that these drugs may cause.<br><br>The typical non-steroidal medications, including OTC drugs, such as ibuprofen and others, along with the more recent drugs such as Celebrex and Vioxx, lead to a significant increased risk in the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding and the real possibility of long-term complications of renal failure.<br><br>Even worse, studies published in medical journals indicate NSAIDs actually INCREASE the progression of the disease. Nowhere in this ad was there any mention about safe, natural alternatives for degenerative arthritis, such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate.  There have been many studies published in reputable medical journals reporting the efficacy of these nutrients for degenerative arthritis.<br><br>A wonderful product containing the correct forms and amounts of <a href="http://rd.mailshell.com/aar51ym/vitacost.sparklist.com/scripts/nph-t.pl?U=66&M=136970&MS=457"><b>glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate</b></a> is available from NSI.  The nutrients come in easy-to-swallow and absorb capsules.  A two-month supply costs only $29.95 or less than $.50 a day.
