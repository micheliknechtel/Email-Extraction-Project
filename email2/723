 ...What's Coming From Microsoft in 2003?...
.............................................

I thought this would be a good time to look ahead at what 
is coming from Microsoft in 2003.  Microsoft has indicated 
the following releases and milestones for this new year. It 
will be interesting to see which of these make it and which 
-- if any -- don't.

 - Expect the release of Windows&reg; .NET Server 2003. This 
   is expected in the first half of this year.

 - Expect the release of the next version of Office ("Office 11"). 
   Among its features, this new version will have broad support 
   for XML.

 - Expect the next version of the Exchange messaging platform, 
   code-named "Titanium." Among its new features is better mobile 
   access.

 - Expect "Jupiter." This is a new, combined version of Microsoft 
   BizTalk(r) Server, Microsoft Commerce Server and Microsoft 
   Content Management Server.

 - Expect SharePoint(tm) Team Services.

 - Expect "XDocs," a new application, built from the ground up. 
   This application which is expected to be a part of the office
   suite of apps, allows you to create rich text forms that can 
   serve as a front end in capturing data.

 - Expect Microsoft Visual Studio&reg; .NET 2003 along with the 
   .NET Framework 1.1. 

 - Expect the release of a 64-bit version of Microsoft SQL Server(tm)
   2000 Enterprise Edition. This version is to take advantage in the 
   enhancements in the 64-bit platform of Windows .NET Server 2003.

- Expect an enterprise-level tool for conducting managed communications 
  via instant messaging - MSN(r) Messenger Connect for Enterprises.

 - Expect speech. Microsoft is working on a number of speech 
   technologies including the release of a beta of the .NET 
   Speech platform, the release to manufacturing of the .NET
   Speech SDK, and browser extensions for Pocket Internet Explorer.

 - Expect a newly upgraded telematics software platform, Windows 
   Automotive. This software will enable easy access to servers, 
   networks and a wide range of Web services from your car.

And most of all, expect coverage on CodeGuru and Developer.com on 
these topics and their impacts.

........................
 ...At the Box Office...
.........................

While unrelated to CodeGuru or even programming, I've 
decided that based on the feedback that I've received that
I will keep the box office information in the newsletter. 
I don't promise to have this every week; however, a large
number of people asked me to keep it -- even though it was
a bit off topic.

This past week-end was very similar to the previous week-end.
The top four movies remained the same. For those of you that
thought Catch Me If You Can would bump Lord of the Rings, I'm
sorry to say, you were wrong. Lord... maintained the first 
place with yet another $25 million. At over $260 million in 
just three weeks, this movie is hot. It is outpacing the first
in the series.

Second place once again falls to Catch Me If You Can. While
I am not a big fan of Leonardo, I must say that I thought he
did a good job in this movie. With another $21 million, this 
movie is not lagging.

Third and fourth place remained with the same as well. In
third was Two Weeks Notice with another $11 million. Fourth 
was Maid in Manhattan with more than another $8 million. 
Gangs of New York fell to number six with just a little over 
$7 million, while About Schmidt moved up from 22nd to 5th 
with just over $8 million.

Until next week... 

Brad!

                New Articles on CodeGuru
==========================================================

Following are short descriptions of new articles on CodeGuru. 
If you are interested in submitting your own article for 
inclusion on the site, then you will find guidelines located
at http://www.codeguru.com/SubmissionsGuidelines.html. 

This week's posted CodeGuru articles:

==> Data - Miscellaneous

  - XMLite: Simple DOM-Based XML Parser - (C++)
     By Cho Kyung Min
    Build a lightweight XML parser. Support non-English 
    languages such as Korean as well as escape characters. 

    http://www.codeguru.com/data-misc/XMLite.html


==> List View

  - Simplified Subitem Editing - (C++)
     By Gunnar Andre' Dalsnes
    A way to subclass the listview edit control. 

    http://www.codeguru.com/listview/subedit.html


==> Managed C++

  - Using the .NET Image Class - (VC++ .NET)
     By Kate Gregory
    Previously Kate showed how to use the ATL CImage class 
    to dramatically simplify working with images in classic
    C++ applications. This time around, she creates the an 
    application as a Managed C++ Windows application and 
    uses System.Drawing.Image to do the heavy lifting. 

    http://www.codeguru.com/cpp_managed/12-KateGregory.html


==> Misc

  - Template Classes for Digital Signal Analysis - (C++)
     By Alexander Beletsky
    Well-known transformations such as Fourier, Walsh, and 
    Haaras are very useful in digital signal processing. 
    This article briefly describes a collection of template
    classes that can be used in digital signal analysis. 

    http://www.codeguru.com/misc/Transform.html


==> .NET General

  - Building Keyboard Accelerators into .NET Windows 
    Forms Applications - (.NET)
     By Kenn Scribner
    Accelerator tables aren't the sexiest thing to code in 
    Microsoft .NET. But ask any professional user interface
    designer and you'll find that keyboard acceleration is 
    usually considered a critical application feature. Rare 
    is the user that has not placed data on the clipboard 
    using Ctrl+C and pasted it into another application using 
    Ctrl+V. Users expect such functionality in GUI applications,
    and .NET Windows Forms applications are no exception. 

    http://www.codeguru.com/net_general/KennS.html


==> System

  - Editing A Remote Hard Disk - (C++)
     By Vinoj Kumar
    Detailed tutorial on reading and writing to disks in 
    Windows 95, NT, and beyond.
