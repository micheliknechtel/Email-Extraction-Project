Greetings SAP folks.=20

I was hoping to have a new SAP week in review feature for you this week, =
but that's going to have to wait one more week. I am working on the launc=
h of a new SAP publication - more on that soon - and I may miss a few of =
my deadlines for this newsletter as a result.=20

But I'll make sure there's plenty of SAP career content for you to look a=
t. Since last week's newsletter, my latest round of SAP career questions =
has been posted to searchSAP.com. I've answered twelve new SAP career que=
stions, including issues such as moving from SD/MM to APO consulting, eva=
luating the viability of APO consulting and BW versus CRM, and looking at=
 why there aren't more opportunities in SAP change management. Other topi=
cs addressed include breaking into SAP, returning to SAP after consulting=
 in other areas, and whether Basis is becoming a commodity skill set. I a=
lso do an in-depth look at the future of HR-payroll consulting, and the f=
uture of SAP-HR consulting in general. So make sure to take a look at tho=
se Q & A's - the direct link is=20
