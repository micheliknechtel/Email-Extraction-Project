Dear Readers:

Last Saturday, January 4th, I appeared on Weekend Today with Soledad O’Brien to comment on Gen X Dads who are staying at home and making it work. In survey after survey, Gen X men—those born between 1965 and 1980—say they intend to put family ahead of work. Instead of climbing the corporate ladder, these dads are turning traditional parenting upside down and making their children their first priority.

This is a subject near to my heart as I have had personal experience wrestling with the pros and cons of trading places. For the last 12 years I have been building my career in the city while my husband Bob worked from home and took primary care of our two children. Based on some of the mistakes we made (and we made all of them), here are some guidelines that we recommend to make it work.

#1. Establish a Dialogue:
Communicate with your spouse every step of the way. It's very important to get problems, resentments and fears out in the open, to confront situations as they come up, and to talk openly, honestly and deeply about the issues.

#2. Be Flexible 
Moms can find it really tough to let go of some of their mothering duties and allow dads to take control of the home and children. But if mom tries to micromanage dad from afar—dad won’t be able to do the job. On the other hand, dad needs to listen carefully to mom’s advice, and be open to her suggestions. 

#3. Divide the Housework:
It’s important to reach an agreement about the division of household labor. Most of it will fall on dad, but mom should be careful not to treat him like Cinderfella. Dads are very likely to hire household help, and making that move can solve a lot of issues.

#4. Reach Compromise:
It can be very tough to reach a compromise on the sticky issues that come up when you are trading places. How clean does the house have to be? How can dinnertime be simplified without sacrificing nutrition? Maybe dad wants to put the kids to bed earlier than mom? Each issue that creates differences needs to be talked through.

#5. Find Quality Time Together:
This is one of the most important tips. If the marriage is just about the kids, the house, and the work, that’s not enough. You need to pay attention to the things that drew you together in the first place. Find quality time for each other whenever you can—make it a steady date. I have a friend who hires a babysitter every Thursday so she and her husband can have dinner together. As Valentine’s Day approaches, a weekly dinner date might be a great gift to each other.

I’d love to hear any ideas you have to share on this topic.
