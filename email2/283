Our Emotional Brains: Both Sides Process The Language Of
Feelings, With The Left Side Labeling The "What" And The Right
Side Processing The "How"

WASHINGTON (American Psychological Association) -- Both sides of
the brain play a role in processing emotional communication, with
the right side stepping in when we focus not on the "what" of an
emotional message but rather on how it feels.

Why Am I Anxious In The Dental Office?

CHICAGO (Academy of General Dentistry) -- People are anxious
about going to the dentist for different reasons, including
worrying about the effectiveness of localized anesthetic and
feeling like the dentist is rushed or is neglecting your
concerns.  Other factors include anticipation of pain, the cost
of the procedure, past experiences, and even the sterile smell of
the dental office.  Interrupting the normal day's routine to
visit the dentist also is a factor in general anxiety.

African-Americans And Depression
Anyone can have clinical depression. However, cultural background plays
a large role in how the symptoms of depression are reported and interpreted, 
and consequently, if and how clinical depression is recognized and treated.

Winter Fitness
It's tempting to just hibernate indoors during the cold-weather months 
with your feet up by a warm fire. Tempting, but not healthful. For even 
though bears hibernate, there are good reasons for humans to leave 
their dens.
