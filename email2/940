Factor 2 - Supervisory Controls

 Work is performed under the very general direction of the supervisor.
Assignments are made in terms of broad objectives to be achieved.  Within
the accepted parameters of the assignment, the incumbent is responsible for
independent planning and organizing work, coordinating with personnel inside
and outside the Federal government, and advising the supervisor of
controversial findings, issues, or problems with potential widespread
impact.  Completed work is reviewed in terms of overall effectiveness in
achieving intended objectives.




Factor 3 - Guidelines




Guidelines consist of general administrative policies, operating procedures,
techniques, practices, etc., which require considerable adaptation and/or
interpretation for application to issues and problems encountered.
Administrative policies and precedent provide a basic outline of results
desired, but do not go into detail as to the methods used to accomplish the
work.  The incumbent must use judgement and ingenuity in the development of
emergency response plans, strategies, and procedures.



Factor 4 - Complexity



HHS is the lead Federal agency for emergency preparedness in the health and
medical services. Work includes a broad range of activities related to the
Department's overall emergency preparedness program and within the Office of
the Assistant Secretary of Public Health Emergency Preparedness, its
policies, plans, programs, and operational activities.  Frequently, the
incumbent independently decides what needs to be done based on each
assignment, the outcome required, and the issues involved.



The position requires attention to step-by-step progression of a large
number of separate activities, and logistical planning to cause a number of
unrelated actions to happen at the proper time in the proper sequence.  The
task is rendered much more difficult by the fact that so much depends upon
the coordination and cooperation of various branches within OASPHEP and
other agencies.  The tasks are further hampered by the unpredictable nature,
time and duration of activations.  In addition to causing actions to occur,
the position requires the ability to analyze what is happening, what if
anything is going wrong, and what to do about it.  A high degree of
analytical ability is needed to assess the situation and respond
accordingly.


Factor 5 - Scope and Effect




The SCC is the focal point of information released to the HHS community
during response operations; it collects, analyzes, synthesizes and reports
all response operation activities.  In media sensitive events, the SCC
Director may work closely with OASPHEP management, HHS Public Affairs
Officers, and others to prepare press releases about an event.  The
incumbent's performance has an effect on the prestige and professional
reputation of the OASPHEP.  A Top Secret will be required for the position.

Factor 6 - Personal Contacts



Incumbent relates directly with the entire OASPHEP staff, agency personnel
staff, Federal, State and local government representatives, NDMS partner
Federal agencies (DoD, VA, and FEMA) and personnel from the NDMS teams.


Factor 7 - Purpose of the Contacts


Contacts are to discuss and coordinate technical issues, render advice and
assistance, resolve problems involving interrelationships of manpower needs
in emergency preparedness and response activities.


Factor 8 - Physical Demands


Persons are expected to be able to be CCRF fully qualified.


Factor 9 - Work Environment


The work is performed in an office setting with some travel to meetings,
conferences, and exercises.  The incumbent is responsible for activating the
SCC.  The incumbent is required to work irregular work schedules (evenings,
nights, and weekends).Work may be subject to tight deadlines and stressful
conditions during emergency assignments.
