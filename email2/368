1. WHAT'S UP - What's new on LondonNet
----------------------------------------

LONDON FOR FREE:
- Club Classical Compie
We are giving away 10 pairs of tickets for BBC Concert Orchestra's Club
Classical. The event is at the Brixton Academy on the 1st February.
- Scroll down for competition details.

----------------------------------------

LONDON EYE:
- 2003 tickets now online
The London Eye, opened in 2000, has now established itself as one of the
capital's prime tourist attractions. The Eye stands a whopping 135 metres=

(450 feet) high on the South Bank between Waterloo and Westminster Bridge=
s,
right opposite Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament and provides stunning=

views over central London and beyond.

Since we started selling tickets for the Eye it has consistently been amo=
ng
our most popular offerings. Indeed official figures show it was London's
most visited paid for attraction last year.

This year's allocation of tickets has now been released and there is
currently availability for almost all days throughout 2003. Last year the=

weekend dates sold out fairly rapidly, so to ensure you don't miss the bo=
at
we really do urge you to plan and book your visit soon.

Thanks to an increase in the number of tickets allocated to us, availabil=
ty
for non-weekend dates should remain good throughout the year. So if you w=
ant
to make a booking closer to the time of your 'Eye Flight' we suggest you
look at weekday slots.

2. LONDON DIARY
- London Laureate: Position Vacant
----------------------------------------

SOMETIMES I like to dip my toe into the job market. Not the real one - I
gave up on that when I caught myself lying about my age, marital status a=
nd,
most pathetically, my hobbies - but the more interesting one that exists =
in
a different, better place.

Over there, they have great jobs for people like me. Once I came close to=

nailing a position as Chief Head Polisher to Sven Goran Eriksson, but was=

beaten at second interview by that 'does exactly what it says on the tin'=

bloke from the Ronseal ad. Another time, only Captain Scarlet's late entr=
y
to the field of applicants prevented me taking up a role as bodyguard to
little Elmo out of Sesame Street. They fell for the indestructible line, =
I'm
afraid, despite clear evidence that plastic puppets melt under intense he=
at.

The new job I'm now gunning for is London Laureate. This job is quite
similar to the one done on a national level by Andrew Motion except that =
it
entails much more money and far fewer poems. Motion never stops does he?
Hardly a day goes by when he doesn't seem to be lamenting the demise of s=
ome
royal personage or versifying against the impending war with Iraq. For us=

laureates less should be more, as we like the dear public to think we wei=
gh
carefully each word before allowing them a chance to tear our work to
pieces. (I got full marks for Artistic Preciousness at the first intervie=
w -
a studiously informal meeting co-chaired by Jon Hegley and Ms Dynamite in=

one of the pods of the London Eye).

I said all the right things about reaching out to those not usually
interested in poetry, making sure, with a delicate wink, they knew I knew=

they knew I was being incredibly media savvy. It all went well until the =
end
when I asked, in rhyme, who it was I would be replacing. Jon looked at Ms=
,
Ms looked at Jon and both exploded into an a cappella version of White Ma=
n
in Hammersmith Palais. Joe Strummer ain't never coming back and his posit=
ion
as bolshy bard of London won't ever be filled.

 3. ENTERTAINMENT
----------------------------------------

THEATRE
http://www.londonnet.co.uk/ln/out/ent/theatre.html

In The Spotlight
http://www.londonnet.co.uk/ln/out/ent/theatre.html#spotlight

The Royal Shakespeare Company finally has a hit on its hands in the form =
of
five undiscovered Jacobean classics. Edward III, Eastward Ho!, The Roman
Actor, The Island Princess and The Malcontent are running in repertory
following a successful transfer from the Swan Theatre in Stratford.

The ambitious project, involving a cast of 28 and five separate directors=
,
marks the RSC's first success in a long while. Former artistic director
Adrian Noble left the company in the lurch when he pulled the RSC out of =
its
Barbican home, made plans to destroy the company's historic Stratford bas=
e
and resigned in April 2002; now the company is back with a vengeance.

In mounting the finest work of Shakespearean contemporaries such as Phili=
p
Massinger, George Chapman and Ben Jonson, the RSC has won new audiences
without losing its loyal following. The future looks surprisingly bright =
for
their forthcoming production of Salmon Rushdie's Midnight's Children.

Matthew Bourne's Nutcracker!
@ Sadler's Wells:
Until 1 Feb 2003

A New Adventures Production. Directed and choreographed by Matthew Bourne=
,
designed by Anthony Ward, original scenario by Matthew Bourne and Martin
Duncan, music by Tchaikovsky performed by The Royal Philharmonic Concert
Orchestra

Award winning British choreographer Matthew Bourne returns to Sadler's We=
lls
with a dazzling new production for New Adventures of his Nutcracker! This=

delicious production is full of his trademark style of wit, pathos and
theatrical magic. From a hilariously bleak Christmas Eve at Dr. Dross'
Orphanage, through a shimmering ice-skating wonderland, to the spectacula=
r
candy folk of Sweetieland, Clara's journey passes through Oliver Twist, t=
he
Icecapades and the kaleidoscopic fantasy of Busby Berkeley musicals. Team=
ing
up again with Olivier award winning designer Anthony Ward and Tchaikovsky=
's
most accessible and much-loved score, Matthew Bourne's Nutcracker! promis=
es
a fresh serving of the traditional Christmas fare and creates a lip smack=
ing
feast for all the family.

Matthew Bourne has achieved both artistic and commercial success with his=

imaginative new versions of classical ballets. His Swan Lake with male
swans, which opened at Sadler's Wells in 1995, went on to become the
longest-running ballet in the West End, winning over 25 International awa=
rds
culminating in a Tony Award winning season on Broadway. Nutcracker!Furthe=
r
West End success followed with Cinderella and The Car Man which won the
Evening Standard Best Musical Award. For the musical theatre he restaged
Oliver! and My Fair Lady for which he won an Olivier Award this year both=
 in
collaboration with Anthony Ward who has also recently designed Chitty Chi=
tty
Bang Bang to much acclaim.

Dear LondonNet,

As a shareholder in the Channel Tunnel I think it's absurd that Eurostar
don't have standby prices.

In fact I've only travelled to Paris once by train - it's so much cheaper=
 by
air!

Francis Pettitt

Ed: We've been asking for standby prices for years now. But as Eurostar
actively ignore budget travellers, we may have to wait several more.
