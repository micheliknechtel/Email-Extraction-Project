1. Kobe Goes Nuts, Sinks NBA-Record 12 Three-Pointers
In the ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER, Kevin Ding writes that it "has been a grim season thus far" for the Lakers. But last night, there was the reminder that "Kobe Bryant can do just about anything on the basketball court." Bryant drilled an "NBA-record 12 three-pointers," nine straight at one point to finish the Lakers' victory with 45 points.

2. Former Knicks GM To Run New Charlotte Franchise 
Rick Bonnell reports in the CHARLOTTE OBSERVER that team "owner Bob Johnson left no doubt Tuesday: Ed Tapscott has the keys to Charlotte's new NBA franchise." On Tuesday, Tapscott "was named executive vice president of Charlotte's new team. In that role, he'll oversee basketball and business aspects of the franchise, which will begin play in the fall of 2004," writes Bonnell.

3. Minute-By-Minute: Jordan Makes It Count
Tony Kornheiser writes in the WASHINGTON POST that in "the beginning of the NBA season," Wizards coach Doug Collins and superstar Michael Jordan agreed "that Jordan wouldn't be a starter." At the time, "that was the plan" and the "antidote" to keep Jordan healthy. Nowadays, that type of thinking is "long gone." Jordan has already "played 40 minutes or more six times" and it's more obvious than ever before that "it's Jordan's world we live in," adds Kornheiser.

4. New Orleans Knows All About Larry Legend 
Peter Finney writes in the NEW ORLEANS TIMES-PICAYUNE that the "Celtics are back in town, live, in living color, for the first time in almost 18 years." In case you're asking, the last time Boston visited the Big Easy was March 12, 1985 to take on the Atlanta Hawks. The "Hawks were playing a 'home game' away from home in UNO's Lakefront Arena" and Larry Bird went to work, scoring 60 memorable points.

5. Celtics Want No Part Of Road Trip
Michael Vega writes in the BOSTON GLOBE that "the Celtics face a grueling four-game road trip that begins at 9 tonight in New Orleans against the Hornets." Boston needs to put together some wins to stay comfortably above .500. "Since mid-December the Celtics have had numerous opportunities to beef up their record," but "losses against opponents with inferior records" have "left the Celtics dreading this trip," adds Vega.

6. Suns' Hardaway Adjusts To Supporting Role 
In the ARIZONA REPUBLIC, Bob Young writes that a "year ago, Penny Hardaway struggled with the idea of playing a supporting role for the Suns." Hardaway "wondered why he wasn't a bigger part of the club's offense." These days, Hardaway is "healthier" and happily "taking what's offered by Suns coach Frank Johnson," adds Young.

7. Grizzlies' Williams Toning It Down?
Ric Bucher writes on ESPN.com that "The Taming" of Jason Williams "has had a wondrous impact on the Memphis Grizzlies, who have now won nine of their last 13 games." Hubie Brown has persuaded JWill to tone "down his circus mentality when it comes to delivering the ball." As a result, the Grizzlies are winning and Williams' numbers are improving.

8. Nets Eyeing Franchise-Record 11th Straight Win
In the NEW YORK POST, Fred Kerber writes that when it comes to the Nets, "success has bred confidence, which has bred more success and taken them far away from their reputation of futility." New Jersey "has won 10 straight games, one shy of equaling" its "NBA franchise-record winning streak," adds Kerber.
