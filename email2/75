**Apple Releases Mac OS X 10.2.3 Update** -- Apple wrapped up 2002
  with the release of Mac OS X 10.2.3, a hefty update that rolls a
  number of improvements and bug fixes in to Jaguar. Some changes
  include compatibility fixes between the Mac and certain digital
  cameras or external CD burners, as well as enhancements to
  applications such as iPhoto, iChat, Mail, Disk Utility, and Disk
  Copy. Mac OS X 10.2.3 also offers better iDisk performance over
  slow or busy network connections, updates Rendezvous networking,
  and makes the changes necessary for the improvements in
  Connectix's Virtual PC 6. The update is available as a mammoth
  51 MB download via Software Update; stand-alone installers
  have also been posted for updating from Mac OS X 10.2.2 or from
  versions 10.2 or 10.2.1 (59 MB). Prompted by discussion on TidBITS
  Talk and some personal experience, we recommend running Disk First
  Aid on your hard disk before installing the update, particularly
  if you've updated all the way from Mac OS X 10.0. [JLC]

**Apple Updates iCal, iSync** -- Two of Apple's flashier
  announcements at the July 2002 Macworld Expo have finally become
  more usable, just in time for the January 2003 Expo. iCal 1.0.2
  brings sorely needed performance improvements to the calendar
  application, including speedier launch times and better importing
  capabilities (meaning, at least in our case, iCal now correctly
  imports vCal and Microsoft Entourage files). iCal 1.0.1, released
  earlier last week, didn't work properly for users in time zones
  10 hours or more from Greenwich Mean Time. Although the release
  notes for version 1.0.2 do not specifically mention this
  particular fix, Apple removed a notice from the iCal download
  page about the problem, so we assume this was a reason for
  releasing another update so quickly. iCal 1.0.2 is a free
  10.4 MB download.

<http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=06880>
<http://www.apple.com/ical/>

  Apple also posted iSync 1.0, the release version of its
  synchronization utility that has been in beta since 30-Sep-02.
  iSync now boasts faster syncing with Palm OS devices, better
  Palm configuration options within iSync (you need the HotSync
  component of Palm Desktop 4.0), automatic synchronization with
  a .Mac account, .Mac Address Book synchronization, and an iSync
  menu bar icon. (In our testing, iSync has been remarkably slow
  and processor intensive.) Beginning 07-Jan-02, .Mac account
  holders will be able to access their Address Book information
  via the Web. iSync 1.0 is a 5.1 MB download. [JLC]

**More Macworld Events** -- This is why I take my iBook with me on
  vacation: things happen! First Creo contacted me to renew their
  TidBITS sponsorship for Six Degrees, and then a flurry of email
  resulted in more Expo events. So, for those looking to chat with
  Glenn and me about The Wireless Networking Starter Kit or any
  other wireless networking related topic, you can drop by the
  DevDepot booth (#3761) at 3:00 PM on Wednesday, 08-Jan-03. They'll
  be selling copies of the book that we're happy to sign, and if
  you miss us there (or are just shy, even though we don't bite),
  both DevDepot and the Macintosh-savvy wireless networking vendor
  MacWireless (booth #1646) will have signed copies of the book.
  Finally, for people not at the show, Glenn and I will be on the
  ScreenSavers show on TechTV on Friday. We're taping from 4:00 PM
  to 5:00 PM, but I'm not sure what that means for when it will be
  on your cable system. Check local listings. [ACE]

TidBITS Using Habeas Headers
----------------------------
  by Adam C. Engst <ace@tidbits.com>

  The spam pandemic has grown to epic proportions. In 2002, I
  received over 23,000 spam messages (about 35 percent of my mail),
  and that's even after employing the Mail Abuse Prevention System
  RBL+ realtime blackhole list and a handful of other conservative
  server-side spam filters on our primary mail server. There's no
  question that my address is both older (it hasn't changed since
  I switched away from the UUCP style <ace@tidbits.uucp>) and more
  widely published than most, but my exposure generally means I'm
  just ahead of the curve. If you're not getting a lot of spam now,
  you're both lucky and living on borrowed time.

<http://mail-abuse.org/rbl/>
<http://www.eudora.co.nz/eimsfilters.html>


**Think Positive** -- Nevertheless, although I don't see the
  amount of spam dropping for a while yet, I think we've turned
  the corner in developing the basic concepts that will eliminate
  most spam from our lives - at least when those concepts are
  intelligently combined and implemented. These concepts include
  so-called Bayesian filtering, which attempts to predict the
  likelihood that a message is spam by the frequencies with which
  certain words occur; whitelists, which allow mail through only
  when it comes from people from whom you've received legitimate
  mail in the past; and challenge/response systems, which require
  that new senders authenticate themselves before their mail reaches
  you. Also potentially useful deterrents are the various U.S.
  state anti-spam laws and the lawsuits against spammers they make
  possible; well-run blackhole lists that let mail servers refuse
  to accept connections from other mail servers that have been
  compromised by spammers; and the combination of proper default
  settings and network administrator education that has cut down
  on the number of open relays for spammers to exploit.

<http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html>
<http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-spamf.html>

  Note that I explicitly do not include arbitrary server-side
  content filtering in that list of potentially useful approaches
  to controlling spam. Creating server-side filters that reject
  mail based on the inclusion of a word or two merely because the
  administrator has seen those words in spam is more damaging
  to the overall utility of email than spam itself. Geoff Duncan
  brought this problem to light with "Email Filtering: Killing
  the Killer App" back in TidBITS-637_; that article triggered
  widespread coverage in mainstream media outlets such as the
  New York Times, the Newhouse News Service, and more.

<http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=06866>
<http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=06869>
<http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/15/technology/15SPAM.html>

  Our efforts at educating the public to the dangers of arbitrary
  content filters certainly don't hurt, but the problem continues.
  Our recent gift issue was rejected by one mail server (which will
  undoubtedly do so again with this issue) because the word "cows"
  appeared in the text. (Ironically, it wasn't even in relation to
  the worthy Heifer Project charity, but to a comment about the game
  Tropico.) In an effort to avoid losing subscribers when these
  content filter rejections trigger our bounce automation, we've
  taken to trying to switch impacted subscribers to the announcement
  version of TidBITS, which is much more likely to slip past content
  filters purely on the basis of containing many fewer words.


**Cue Habeas** -- There's one more new tool that we've just
  started to employ. A new company called Habeas, started by TidBITS
  author Dan Kohn, has come up with "sender warranted email." The
  idea is that, with the addition of nine specific header lines to
  your messages, you can warrant that your outgoing email is not
  spam. ISPs, email providers, spam filters, and even individual
  recipients can then trust that any incoming message that contains
  Habeas headers is legitimate.

<http://www.habeas.com/>

Here's what the Habeas headers look like.

 X-Habeas-SWE-1: winter into spring
 X-Habeas-SWE-2: brightly anticipated
 X-Habeas-SWE-3: like Habeas SWE (tm)
 X-Habeas-SWE-4: Copyright 2002 Habeas (tm)
 X-Habeas-SWE-5: Sender Warranted Email (SWE) (tm). The sender of this
 X-Habeas-SWE-6: email in exchange for a license for this Habeas
 X-Habeas-SWE-7: warrant mark warrants that this is a Habeas Compliant
 X-Habeas-SWE-8: Message (HCM) and not spam. Please report use of this
 X-Habeas-SWE-9: mark in spam to <http://www.habeas.com/report/>.

  "But but but...," I can hear you saying. "What prevents spammers
  from simply adding the Habeas headers to spam as well?" Nothing.
  Well, except for the thousandweight of lawyers that Habeas plans
  to drop on anyone who does so, basing such lawsuits on both
  copyright and trademark law. Habeas can do this because the
  Habeas headers include a copyrighted three-line haiku and several
  trademarks. In addition, Habeas will add any infringers to a
  DNS-based blacklist that doesn't suffer from some of the legal
  problems that have plagued other blacklists.

  I'm waiting with bated breath to see how Habeas handles the
  first infringers. My experience with suing a spammer under the
  Washington State anti-spam law wasn't great because I couldn't
  expend the money, time, and effort to carry the suit through to
  the most satisfactory conclusion. In contrast, Habeas has venture
  capital and significant incentive to make examples of infringers,
  so they're likely to have a better chance of running the spammers
  to ground and extracting financial penalties from them. By basing
  the protection on copyright and trademark law, Habeas avoids the
  many variations on state anti-spam laws and doesn't have to wait
  for federal legislation that may be too little and is already too
  late. Plus, international copyright law offers similar protections
  everywhere but Afghanistan, Bhutan, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Nepal,
  Oman, San Marino, Tonga, and Yemen. On the collection side, Habeas
  plans to turn spammers over to the collection agency Dun &
  Bradstreet for maximum extraction.

<http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbser=1167>

  Although there are some high-profile spammers who are making very
  real money at spam (but are stupid enough to give their real names
  in interviews, opening themselves up to real world harassment from
  furious spam victims), I doubt Habeas will end up making
  significant money from successful lawsuits. Most spammers simply
  don't have deep pockets. However, Habeas does earn money from
  licensing the Habeas headers to businesses. Licenses are free for
  individuals and ISPs that warrant that all their email is not
  spam; other companies pay $200 per year for a license unless their
  business revolves around sending verified opt-in commercial email,
  at which point the license is based on the number of recipients.

<http://www.habeas.com/services/swe.htm>


**Practical Habeas** -- From a user's standpoint, you need to know
  two things about Habeas: how to add Habeas headers to your email
  messages (remember, it's free for individuals) and how to filter
  Habeas warranted messages. The details vary significantly with the
  software you use for email, but Habeas has developed instructions
  and plug-ins for many common pieces of email software (it's just
  a matter of dropping a plug-in into the appropriate folder with
  Eudora, for instance), and they're happy to post user-submitted
  instructions for additional programs. Also, many email programs
  hide unusual headers by default, and for those programs that
  don't, Habeas also offers instructions for hiding the Habeas
  headers so you don't have to look at them in every message.

<http://www.habeas.com/support/install.htm>

  What are we hoping to get out of adding Habeas headers to our
  mailing lists? Quite simply, less damage due to errant spam
  filters. Habeas is working with many of the vendors of server-
  side spam filters to encourage them to whitelist Habeas compliant
  messages, and we hope that anyone who has gone to the effort of
  rolling their own spam filters will do the same to reduce the
  incidence of false positive spam identification. I encourage
  everyone who's concerned about spam to sign up for a free
  individual Habeas license, and for anyone working on anti-spam
  tools, make sure your tools whitelist Habeas compliant messages
  as well.

  There's no question that the use of Habeas headers will not
  eliminate the spam problem overnight, but when combined with the
  other tools and techniques that have started to appear, it should
  make a difference.

Virtual PC 6 Fits In and Performs
---------------------------------
  by Mark H. Anbinder <mha@tidbits.com>

  On 18-Dec-02, Connectix Corporation released a new version of
  Virtual PC, the company's PC emulation software. Virtual PC 6
  focuses on improving the integration between Macintosh and Windows
  operating systems, and on boosting performance, especially under
  Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar.

<http://www.connectix.com/products/vpc6m.html>


**Dockworkers Unite** -- Mac OS X users can take advantage of
  Virtual PC 6's most obvious features: several ways of interacting
  with the Dock. In addition to the Virtual PC application icon
  itself appearing when the program's running (like any other),
  icons for each Windows application you launch also appear in the
  Dock. Windows application icons may be kept in the Dock for ease
  of launching Virtual PC when it's not running. Best of all is a
  separate icon for the Windows Start menu, which appears in the
  Dock whether or not Virtual PC is running. This icon gives you
  access to everything in your Start menu, such as Windows
  applications, documents, settings, and whatever else you've
  got in there. (And yes, you can turn these Dock integration
  features off.)

  Our immediate thought, upon seeing the new Dock integration
  features, was that a future version of Virtual PC should take the
  next step and run individual Windows applications in their own
  windows, just as individual Classic applications run in their own
  windows with their own distinctive menu bars. (A good intermediate
  step would be for the Dock icons to let you change which
  application is frontmost within VPC's Windows environment, which
  doesn't work now.) Obviously, there are times when it makes more
  sense to emulate the full Windows environment, but for those
  Virtual PC users who use a single Windows application, it could be
  far more convenient to avoid using Windows entirely. Such a change
  would require a significant development effort from Connectix, so
  if you would find such a feature helpful in your use of Virtual
  PC, make sure to let them know.

  Connectix says the overall performance of Virtual PC 6 is about
  25 percent faster, thanks partly to changes Apple made in Jaguar.
  (The speed boost requires Mac OS X 10.2.3.)

  We're delighted to see the return of the capability to mount
  Virtual PC drive images in the Finder. However, it's unfortunate
  that drives cannot be mounted if they are part of either an active
  or saved PC environment. The "save state" feature of Virtual PC,
  which lets you pause your Windows environment at any time and
  return to it later without having to wait for Windows to start
  up all over again, is one of its strongest capabilities -
  discouraging users from the habit of saving their PC's state
  every time they're ready to quit Virtual PC seems a shame.
  (To mount a drive image that's part of a saved state, the user
  must first restore the PC from its saved state, and shut down
  Windows.)

  TidBITS readers often remind us that, while the vast majority of
  new product announcements focus on Mac OS X compatibility, there's
  still a large installed base of Mac OS 9 users. Such folks will be
  happy to note that Virtual PC still supports Mac OS 9. The
  capability to use the same PC configuration, drive images, and
  even saved states, whether you're in Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X at any
  given moment, is a wonderful boon to those who often switch their
  computers between the two operating systems. (At least Virtual PC
  won't be the application forcing you to switch!)

  Lastly, Virtual PC is famous for supporting many more monitor
  resolutions than that of average video card drivers, including the
  wide-format screens of the PowerBook G4 with its 1280 by 854 LCD.
  Virtual PC 6 adds support for newer displays like the Apple 23-
  inch HD Cinema Display, at 1920 by 1200 pixels.


**Buying and Upgrading** -- Virtual PC 6 costs $130 for the PC DOS
  edition, $220 for the Windows XP Home or Windows 98 editions, $250
  for the Windows 2000 and Windows XP Pro editions, or $100 for an
  upgrade-only package (with no DOS or Windows OS included). The
  upgrade and DOS editions are available immediately; packages with
  various Windows operating systems should be starting to reach
  resellers soon.

  Virtual PC users who purchased Virtual PC 5.0 on 01-Nov-02 or
  later (through 31-Mar-03) are eligible for a discounted upgrade
  upon faxing or mailing an eligibility form along with appropriate
  documentation. The upgrade costs $5 for an electronic download,
  $10 for physical shipment within the U.S. or Canada, or $20 for
  shipment to other parts of the world.

Back to 2002, Forward to 2003
-----------------------------
  by Adam C. Engst <ace@tidbits.com>

  Last year at about this time, I made a few predictions about what
  I thought the top stories of 2002 would be (see "Peering Into
  2002's Tea Leaves" in TidBITS-612_). Overall, I did pretty well,
  particularly in saying that the battle over digital content would
  rage throughout 2002 and that wireless networking would continue
  its ascendence. Open for argument are whether I was right in
  saying that 2002 wouldn't bring much of interest in the PDA world
  and whether my lukewarm prediction that broadband Internet access
  might recover in 2002. More interesting is the fact that I think
  some of last year's top stories will continue to dominate our
  attention this year.

<http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=06688>


**The Copyright Wars** -- The copyright wars continued unabated
  throughout all of 2002, with the Content Cartel fighting tooth
  and nail to preserve their existing business models against the
  reality that, for better or worse, sharing of digital content has
  become a way of life for a vast number of people. It's safe to say
  that copyright and peer-to-peer file sharing will remain in the
  news throughout 2003. There's no way the Content Cartel will
  suddenly convince millions of people to stop sharing files, but
  it's equally unlikely that big media companies will admit defeat
  and start giving away their content online.

  And as far as the legal part of the equation goes, I also don't
  see major changes being applied to the DMCA and its brethren.
  There may be a few minor victories, such as happened recently when
  a jury acquitted the Russian firm Elcomsoft in one of the first
  cases brought under the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA.
  Also interesting reading were the comments submitted to the
  Library of Congress in that body's search for possible classes
  of works that should be made exempt from DMCA's prohibition on
  circumvention of copy-prevention technologies. But one way or
  another, the world of politics moves slowly.

<http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2003/comments/>
<http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=06997>


**It's a Wireless World** -- Wireless networking came a long way
  in 2002, with precipitous price drops, progress on faster
  standards, and an ever-increasing number of community networks.
  If anything, the rate of change is going to increase in the
  wireless world in 2003. Right now, 802.11b is essentially just
  a liberating replacement for Ethernet cables, but it's in many
  ways just the first step.

  802.11a and 802.11g are likely to make their appearance in multi-
  band access points that work with any flavor of 802.11, and as the
  cost of chipsets comes down, we'll start seeing wireless network
  access being built into less common devices. It's easy to imagine
  a wireless-enabled MP3 stereo component (we're not far off with
  the SliMP3 from Slim Devices), or a wireless-enabled car MP3
  player that can download songs from your Mac while you're parked
  in the driveway (an engineer friend patched one of these together
  a while back, but she has serious hardware and software hacking
  skills). I could also imagine wireless-enabled digital cameras
  that sport their own Web servers or that can upload or email
  pictures directly from the camera without the need for a computer
  (Sanyo claims they're developing a prototype of something
  similar). Memory card full while you're on vacation? Visit
  a wireless-enabled Internet cafe and off-load all those pictures
  to your server at home.

  I'm looking to see Apple making some significant moves with regard
  to wireless in 2003. Although Apple kickstarted the wireless
  revolution by selling the AirPort Base Station and AirPort cards
  cheaply at first, Apple's prices aren't competitive any more, and
  apart from an integrated modem and support for AOL, AirPort simply
  no longer stands out. If Apple were to make the AirPort Base
  Station support both 802.11a and 802.11g (which itself is backward
  compatible with today's 802.11b) simultaneously, and do the same
  for AirPort cards, the Mac would once again clearly be the
  preeminent platform for wireless networking. Apple might even
  benefit from upgrade revenue as existing AirPort users replace
  their current cards and access points in search of better
  performance.

  Bluetooth will also be taking off in 2003 as a wireless cable
  replacement, and I wouldn't be at all surprised to see Apple
  building it into every Mac. Steve Jobs can't be happy about the
  aesthetic mess of cables emanating from the back of every Mac
  (or when it trails from the bottom of the Power Mac G4 Cube), and
  Bluetooth support would set Apple on track for eliminating many
  of those messy cables.


**PDAs Evolve?** As much as 2002 was a ho-hum year for PDAs, 2003
  could be the year that new form factors for digital devices take
  off. Apple's success with the iPod, which remains one of the
  best-selling MP3 players despite its hefty price tag, shows that
  people are willing to spend money on digital devices that aren't
  strictly necessary as long as the overall package is sufficiently
  attractive.

  As far as what we'll see in 2003, the likely products will
  approach from two directions - the cell phone and the tablet
  computer. The cell phone market has slowed as manufacturers have
  struggled to find compelling ways to differentiate new phones
  from the previous generation, but there's no question that anyone
  developing a portable digital device would do well to consider
  adding cell phone capabilities, much as the Handspring Treo and
  the Danger hiptop (marketed by T-Mobile as the Sidekick) have
  in 2002.

  Tablet PCs made their appearance in 2002, and although the reviews
  weren't stellar, success will be a matter of finding the sweet
  spot. Apple stands a better chance at doing that than any of the
  PC manufacturers (with the possible exception of Sony), given
  Apple's strong design sense, emphasis on digital media, and
  customer base that's willing to pay more for quality hardware.
  The trick, I think, is that a tablet Mac must not attempt to
  compete with an iBook, but should be focused on playing digital
  media - DVD movies and MP3 music - and Web browsing (via AirPort,
  of course). That's not to say it can't have a full version of
  Mac OS X under the hood, with a version of the Finder that's
  appropriate to whatever controller devices are available. At that
  point, the addition of a keyboard and trackpad via Bluetooth turns
  it into a perfectly useful portable computer for the relatively
  simple tasks most of us perform while traveling; but, the device
  would emphasize sitting on the couch browsing the Web while
  listening to MP3s over being a no-compromises laptop like the
  Titanium PowerBook G4.

  Will some sort of Apple PDA really appear in 2003, whether it's on
  the cell phone or the tablet end of the spectrum? I have no inside
  knowledge, but Apple is the sort of company that can grow only
  through constant innovation, and the iPod has proven that the
  company can extend its efforts to digital media devices
  successfully. And of course, rumors of Apple developing a PDA have
  been swirling since the demise of the Newton, so it could be just
  collective wishful thinking.


**Extreme LuCiDity** -- Lastly, although I'm not sure it's going
  to be in the news all that much in 2003, look for LCD displays to
  be dropping significantly in price as the year goes on. That's not
  terribly interesting in itself - all technology gets cheaper - but
  in the case of LCD displays, I'm fascinated by some of the
  possibilities a cheap display presents. I started down this line
  of thinking a few months back when my old NEC 3FGe 15-inch utility
  monitor died. I didn't want to pay much for a new monitor, and
  since it's the sort of thing I use on my PCs every few months,
  or on servers when remote control isn't sufficient, I decided
  that a svelte LCD monitor would be ideal. Thanks to dealmac,
  I was shocked (and gratified) to find a 14-inch LCD monitor
  for $150. The display quality stinks for normal use, but it's
  perfect for a few hours of use every couple of weeks.

  The LCD display was a necessary aspect of enabling the creation
  of laptop computers that let us escape the tyranny of the desk,
  and we may also start to see people exploiting the size and
  flexibility of LCDs in other ways. The concept of hanging a
  monitor on the wall to save desk space or enable a standing
  workstation is obvious, but you can go further.

  With the cost dropping so low, you don't have to be Bill Gates to
  buy an LCD monitor and hang it on your wall as art. Photo slide
  shows, screensaver patterns, iTunes visualizer displays, or even
  SereneScreen's Marine Aquarium (since I never had the guts to
  venture beyond freshwater tropical fish) would all be welcome on
  my walls. I love the concept of the Ceiva digital picture frame,
  but it's small, expensive, and requires a monthly service. Putting
  an older Mac to work running a digital picture certainly wouldn't
  be cheaper than a Ceiva, but the picture could be much larger and
  using .Mac shared slideshows beats using Ceiva's mind-boggingly
  awful Web interface.

  Of course, there are far more exciting advances in display
  technology coming down the pike, such as massive LCD displays like
  Samsung's recently announced 54 inch (137 cm) display, organic LED
  displays that can be laid down using inkjet printing technology,
  LCD paint that could turn a wall or a piece of clothing into a
  display, and electronic paper that could provide the tactile
  sensation of reading a book along with the flexibility of being
  a digital display device. Will any of these technologies make a
  difference in our lives in 2003? Probably not, but hopefully the
  early products using them will give us something more to look
  forward to in 2004.
