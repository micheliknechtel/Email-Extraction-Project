TODAY'S ODDITIES:

These two guys my friend knows work for Chase Bank.  Every year they go to
Australia for a big, bank-sponsored golf tournament.  This past year, these
guys and their team won the entire tournament and went on to drink lots of
beers and celebrate while wearing their newly-won green tournament jackets.
After drinking up a storm, they plopped into their rented car and were
driving on deserted roads nearby when they accidentally hit a large
kangaroo.  Getting out of the car, they realized that the kangaroo had died
in the accident.

Being so drunk, though, they propped up the kangaroo, its lifeless head
bouncing from one side to the other, dressed it in one of their new green
jackets, and took pictures of themselves with their arms around it.  After a
few minutes of picture-taking, the guys were shocked when it seemed that the
kangaroo came back to life!  It turns out that the poor kangaroo wasn't
dead, but it had passed out, and when it came back to consciousness started
to box with the drunken guys!  It actually broke one guy's jaw!!  It then
hopped away into the landscape. The men couldn't drive their rented car, as
the keys, the owner's wallet and passport were in the green jacket, which
was still on the kangaroo.  A little while later, a pack of kangaroos was
seen in the distance, one of them wearing the green jacket.
