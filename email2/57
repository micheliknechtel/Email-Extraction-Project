Padres Team Report
01/10/2003
 
Tom Krasovic
San Diego Union-Tribune



Eleven minor leaguers from the Dominican Republic played last season for the organization under false names and ages. Class A CF Pedro de los Santos, one of the team's best prospects, is actually Freddy Guzman, and he's 22—30 months older than believed. ROTATION ANALYSIS: RHP Brian Lawrence is close to being an ace. He has a slider and an excellent sinker. RHP Adam Eaton can work over a lineup with four pitches; RHP Jake Peavy throws a sinker. Lefties are uncomfortable against LHP Oliver Perez, who might have the most upside. RHP Kevin Jarvis returns from elbow surgery.

AROUND THE N.L. WEST

ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS

The team is pursuing contract extensions for LHP Randy Johnson and LF Luis Gonzalez, both of whom have a year left on their contracts. Having deals in hand before the season could benefit their play. Johnson seemed distracted in 1998 while negotiating with the Mariners, and Gonzalez's performance might have been affected last year by his desire to earn a big payday. ROTATION ANALYSIS: Johnson, who turns 40 in September but shows no signs of slowing, and RHP Curt Schilling are baseball's top 1-2 punch. Schilling made a commitment to offseason training, losing more than 10 pounds and increasing his flexibility. The team thinks it has a solid No. 3 in RHP Elmer Dessens, who was sixth in the N.L. last year with a 3.03 ERA. RHPs Miguel Batista and rookie John Patterson are penciled in for the final two spots, but RHP Byung-Hyun Kim and RHP Armando Reynoso might get looks. —Ed Price

COLORADO ROCKIES

Even with free-agent 3B Chris Stynes signed, the team is continuing to pursue IFs Tyler Houston, who could platoon with Stynes, and Jose Hernandez, who could play second or give SS Juan Uribe time to develop at Class AAA. ROTATION ANALYSIS: The staff is lead by RHP Jason Jennings, the 2002 Rookie of the Year, who says he must throw his changeup more to enhance his nasty sinker and slider. RHP Denny Stark's sinker and tenacity suggest his 11-4 mark in '02 won't be a fluke. LHP Denny Neagle, 34, the oldest starter, must prove he's healthy after having bone spurs removed from his elbow. RHP Scott Elarton's big curve and serviceable fastball don't seem like a good fit at Coors Field. Rookie RHP Aaron Cook will battle RHP Shawn Chacon for the No. 5 spot. —Troy E. Renck

LOS ANGELES DODGERS

1B Fred McGriff's arrival gives manager Jim Tracy the opportunity to alternate lefthanded and righthanded hitters in the middle of the order; he can hit RF Shawn Green, who hits lefthanded, third, followed by LF Brian Jordan, McGriff and 3B Adrian Beltre. ROTATION ANALYSIS: Getting starts from RHP Kevin Brown and LHP Kazuhisa Ishii is crucial. Brown hasn't been healthy in two years and is coming off back surgery. Ishii was hit in the head by a line drive in his last start of 2002, causing concern about lingering psychological effects. RHP Hideo Nomo is the staff leader; he can be dominant when his control is on. The ace could be LHP Odalis Perez. If he continues to show perfect arm speed, he could win 18 games. RHPs Darren Dreifort and Andy Ashby should compete for the fifth spot. Dreifort hasn't pitched since June 2001 because of arm surgery. —Brian Dohn

SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS

The pursuit of free agent Jose Hernandez seems odd because he has mainly been an infielder, something the team isn't lacking. But Hernandez could play right field, and the team is looking for versatility. ROTATION ANALYSIS: RHP Jason Schmidt is a power pitcher who has 20-win stuff. If he added an off-speed pitch, he could resemble Diamondbacks RHP Curt Schilling. LHP Kirk Rueter routinely wins 10-plus games. Promising Damian Moss has just one full year of big-league experience. RHP Livan Hernandez has lost velocity and, it seems, his ability to win consistently.  Incumbent RHP Ryan Jensen will be pushed for the No. 5 spot by RHPs Kurt Ainsworth, Jesse Foppert and Jerome Williams. —Henry Schulman
