Competitive Politics
----------------------------------------

A couple of opposing candidates for county office happened
to be sitting next to each other in the local diner. One
turned to the other and said, "You know why I'm going to win
this election? Because of my 'personal touch.' For example, I
always tip waitresses really well and then ask them to vote
for me."

"Oh, really?" replied the other. "I always tip them a nickel
and ask them to vote for you."

How to Fix a Dent in Your Car
----------------------------------------

A blonde was driving home and got caught in a really bad
hailstorm. Her car was covered with
dents, so the next day she took it to the repair shop.

The shop owner saw that she was a blonde and decided to have
some fun. He told her just to go home and blow into the tail
pipe really hard and all the dents would pop out.

So, the blonde went home, got down on her hands and knees
and started blowing into her tail pipe.  Nothing happened.
She blew a little harder and still nothing happened.

Her roommate, also a blonde came home and said, "What are
you doing?"

The blonde told her how the repairman had instructed her to
blow in the tailpipe in order to get all the dents to pop
out.

Her blonde roommate rolled her eyes and said, "Duh! Hello!
You need to roll up the windows first!"

Today's Quote
http://www.houseofquotes.com

Life isn't about whether you danced with your dream date or whether you made the basketball team. It's about being happy and living to see the people you love, to do the things you love, and to love the life that loves you all the same.
         --- Sue Zimmerman

Viking Fans
----------------------------------------

A Green Bay Packer fan in a bar leans over to the guy next
to him and says, "Wanna hear a joke about Minnesota Viking
fans?"

The guy next to him replies, "Well, before you tell that
joke you should know something. I'm 6' tall and 220 pounds
and I'm a Viking fan. The guy sitting next to me is 6'2"
tall, 240 pounds and he's a Viking fan, and the guy sitting
next to him is 6'5", 280 pounds and he's a Viking fan, too.
Now, do you still wanna tell that joke?"

The Packer fan says, "Nah, not if I'm gonna have to explain
it three times."

Expensive Monkeys
----------------------------------------

A man walks into a Silicon Valley pet store looking to buy a
monkey. 

The store owner points towards three identical looking
monkeys in politically-correct, animal-friendly natural
mini-habitats. 

"The one on the left costs $500," says the store owner.

"Why so much?" asks the customer. 

"Because it can program in C," answers the store owner.

The customer inquires about the next monkey and is told,
"That one costs $1500. It knows Visual C++ and
Object-Relational technology." 

The startled man then asks about the third monkey.

"That one costs $3000," answers the store owner. 

"3000 dollars!!" exclaims the man. "What can that one do?" 

To which the owner replies, "To be honest, I've never seen
it do a single thing, but it calls itself a Consultant."
