STRIP/MALL

The largest mall ever built in Russia opened to much 
fanfare last week.  It's called the "mega" mall, 
presumably because it is big.  To celebrate its gala 
opening, colorfully garbed peasants streamed in from
their de-collectivized farms.

The complex will cover 170 thousand square meters
consisting of five International departments stores,
250 smaller shops, 10 restaurants, and a day care 
center, where parents who are busy shopping can safely 
leave their kids to play in the adult-supervised 
"vodka pit."

Meanwhile, halfway around the world, but just inches 
from the wallet part of your pants, the world's 
largest strip club opened in Las Vegas called the
"Sapphire Gentleman's Club."

On busy nights, the sapphire will feature as many as 
eight hundred strippers, settling once and for all 
the question of whether America as a society is 
going to hell.

ALLEGED HUMOR
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

CRAWFORD PINES: WE CAN HELP.

Do you or someone who hits you have an anger problem?
Do you find yourself often...
* Returning yet another TV set broken by a mysterious
  flying coffee table?
* Awaking in the lion cage in the zoo, with matted fur
  covering your knuckles?
* Adjusting your boss's necktie so that it relieves 
  him of all circulation?

If so, you might be a candidate for treatment at 
Crawford Pines Clinic for Anger Management.

Founded in upstate New York by Dr. Thaddeus Crawford 
in 1996 on the site of a former lemur ranch, Crawford 
Pines provides a quiet, rustic atmosphere for patients 
to resolve their aggression issues. Patients at 
Crawford stay in cozy bungalows located in deep woods 
far from the hustle and bustle of civilization. Each 
unit is fully furnished with chains and floors. 
Crawford Pines is dedicated to helping clients reach 
a state of permanent non-violence. This is achieved 
either by giving clients a sense of inner peace or, 
more often, by irreparably shattering their sense of 
self, leading to a state of confused docility. We count 
either outcome a success.

Often, when patients arrive at Crawford Pines, they 
behave like bulls -- fierce, strong animals, bucking 
at the restraints of authority and societal 
limitations. So we treat you like bulls. One of our 
cowpokes punches a thick ring through your septum and 
leaves you in a large corral. After an hour of futile 
thrashing, you'll be ready for one of our esteemed 
behaviorists to ride you. He'll kick you with his spurs 
and counsel you to "try and be more empathetic, " and 
to "count to 10 before responding."

Many abusive people take things "too personally," 
attaching anger to random events that could happen to 
anybody. At Crawford Pines, we give a focus for their 
anger: ourselves. We, the doctors, nurses and thugs of 
Crawford Pines, become legitimate targets for 
hostility. In this system, anger becomes a healthy 
response. After we attempt to make you "see things 
through other people's eyes" by not allowing you to 
close yours, displays of anger become a healthy 
response. We prefer our patients to have some spirit.
It makes therapy more... sporting.

However, at Crawford Pines, we are not limited to 
violence as a treatment method. We also believe in 
sadistic humiliation. So if you, the patient, continue 
to "act out", we will do exactly what our parents used 
to do to us. It is a three-stage treatment designed to 
foster guilt and embarrassment for taking that tone 
with me, buster.

* First, we will subject you to a creamed-corn enema, 
  a humiliation sure to soften your aggressive 
  personality into a puddle of shame.
* Then we will hang your sheet out the window, 
  suggesting to the entire world that you wet the bed 
  like a stupid baby.
* Finally, we will lock you in the closet with only 
  blotter acid for food.

So help us help ourselves by helping you. Call 
Crawford Pines today.

WEEKLY HOROSCOPES FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S KARMA CENTRAL
S. Felber, Astrologer karmascentral@yahoo.com 
http://www.comedycentral.com/timewasters/kc/
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

TAURUS
(April 20 - May 20)
The person you are attracted to is so evil. Or to put
it another way, the person you are attracted to is
sooooooooo evil. Of course you're scared. You should 
be. But really you shouldn't be.

Get your complete horoscope here. 
http://www.comedycentral.com/timewasters/kc/karma_horosub_taurus.jhtml 

GEMINI
(May 21 - June 20)
In Finland, the cab drivers must now pay royalties on 
any music they play for customers in their cab. It's 
about 22 American dollars a year, so while people don't
like it, they accept it even though it's super wacky.

Get your complete horoscope here. 
http://www.comedycentral.com/timewasters/kc/karma_horosub_gemini.jhtml 

CANCER
(June 21 - July 22)
Last week was all about water retention, and this week 
is still about you feeling pretty bad. If you aren't 
still bloated, you feel like an old rawhide bone. You 
feel all chewed up, dirty and ragged.

Get your complete horoscope here. 
http://www.comedycentral.com/timewasters/kc/karma_horosub_cancer.jhtml 

LEO
(July 23 - Aug 22)
In Finland, Elks weigh about 440 pounds. This year, 
cops in Finland are cracking down on speeders, hoping 
to reduce the elk/car-induced fatalities. At the same 
time, the government is issuing loads more hunting 
licenses to cut down the exploding elk population.

Get your complete horoscope here. 
http://www.comedycentral.com/timewasters/kc/karma_horosub_leo.jhtml 

VIRGO
(Aug 23 - Sept 22)
You are suffering a crisis not unlike the Finnish. 
Y'all are spending too much time with one person who 
warms the cockles of your heart. They are also 
suffering from over-consumption of something they 
dearly love; namely, the heat of a 
roast-your-cockles-off sauna.

Get your complete horoscope here. 
http://www.comedycentral.com/timewasters/kc/karma_horosub_virgo.jhtml 

LIBRA
(Sept 23 - Oct 22)
Oh you lucky Libra! This week Leo is after you and 
Taurus remains all over your jock. But don't answer 
yet. This week Aquarius is warming to you. Libra and 
Aquarius! A very odd match indeed!

Get your complete horoscope here. 
http://www.comedycentral.com/timewasters/kc/karma_horosub_libra.jhtml 

SCORPIO
(Oct 23 - Nov 21)
So last week we were suggesting nude housecleaning with 
a Virgo might easily come to pass. This week, while your 
ability to attract remains at an all time high, so does 
your ability to contract. Yes, you are very prone to a 
nasty winter bug.

Get your complete horoscope here. 
http://www.comedycentral.com/timewasters/kc/karma_horosub_scorpio.jhtml 

SAGITTARIUS
(Nov 22 - Dec 21)
Your week will have the highs and lows of a family 
wedding. They'll be lots of love, happy tearful moments 
and merriment. Merriment coupled with family and/or old 
friends recounting who's dying, who's dead, and what 
carried them off.

Get your complete horoscope here. 
http://www.comedycentral.com/timewasters/kc/karma_horosub_sagittarius.jhtml 

CAPRICORN
(Dec 22 - Jan 19)
Seeing as it is still your birthday month, we thought 
we might address a famous Capricorn born recently -- 
the cloned baby from Clonaid. Clonaid is, of course, 
funded by the Raelians -- a religious sect that believes 
space aliens created life on Earth through cloning.

Get your complete horoscope here. 
http://www.comedycentral.com/timewasters/kc/karma_horosub_capricorn.jhtml 

AQUARIUS
(Jan 20 - Feb. 18)
In Toronto, a plywood Santa was lifted from a lawn and 
kidnapped. The thieves demanded cans of food for a food 
bank. They even showed pictures of the Santa on their
notes and had struck this particular house before.

Get your complete horoscope here. 
http://www.comedycentral.com/timewasters/kc/karma_horosub_aquarius.jhtml 

PISCES
(Feb 19 - March 20)
This is a week of losing things for Pisces. Bookmarks, 
books, and even reading glasses. But while you will be 
driven to distraction, the passionate anger that will 
flare up inside you will make you lose something you 
never needed in the first place -- many of your 
inhibitions.

Get your complete horoscope here. 
http://www.comedycentral.com/timewasters/kc/karma_horosub_pisces.jhtml 

ARIES
(March 21 - April 19)
This week your life performs like a paper coffee cup.
Things will be convenient, filled with energizing stuff
yet prone to disintegrating. Best thing to do is cram
all the exciting stuff in really quickly.

<br><br>
The complex will cover 170 thousand square meters consisting of five International departments stores, 250 smaller shops, 10 restaurants, and a day care center, where parents who are busy shopping can safely leave their kids to play in the adult-supervised "vodka pit."
<br><br>
Meanwhile, halfway around the world, but just inches from the wallet part of your pants, the world's largest strip club opened in Las Vegas called the "Sapphire Gentleman's Club."
<br><br>
On busy nights, the sapphire will feature as many as eight hundred strippers, settling once and for all the question of whether America as a society is going to hell.

Do you or someone who hits you have an anger problem? Do you find yourself often...<br>
* Returning yet another TV set broken by a mysterious flying coffee table?<br>
* Awaking in the lion cage in the zoo, with matted fur covering your knuckles?<br>
* Adjusting your boss's necktie so that it relieves him of all circulation?
<br><br>
If so, you might be a candidate for treatment at Crawford Pines Clinic for Anger Management.
<br><br>
Founded in upstate New York by Dr. Thaddeus Crawford in 1996 on the site of a former lemur ranch, Crawford Pines provides a quiet, rustic atmosphere for patients to resolve their aggression issues. Patients at Crawford stay in cozy bungalows located in deep woods far from the hustle and bustle of civilization. Each unit is fully furnished with chains and floors. Crawford Pines is dedicated to helping clients reach a state of permanent non-violence. This is achieved either by giving clients a sense of inner peace or, more often, by irreparably shattering their sense of self, leading to a state of confused docility. We count either outcome a success.
<br><br>
Often, when patients arrive at Crawford Pines, they behave like bulls -- fierce, strong animals, bucking at the restraints of authority and societal limitations. So we treat you like bulls. One of our cowpokes punches a thick ring through your septum and leaves you in a large corral. After an hour of futile thrashing, you'll be ready for one of our esteemed behaviorists to ride you. He'll kick you with his spurs and counsel you to "try and be more empathetic," and to "count to 10 before responding."
<br><br>
Many abusive people take things "too personally," attaching anger to random events that could happen to anybody. At Crawford Pines, we give a focus for their anger: ourselves. We, the doctors, nurses and thugs of Crawford Pines, become legitimate targets for hostility. In this system, anger becomes a healthy response. After we attempt to make you "see things through other people's eyes" by not allowing you to close yours, displays of anger become a healthy response. We prefer our patients to have some spirit. It makes therapy more... sporting.
<br><br>
However, at Crawford Pines, we are not limited to violence as a treatment method. We also believe in sadistic humiliation. So if you, the patient, continue to "act out", we will do exactly what our parents used to do to us. It is a three-stage treatment designed to foster guilt and embarrassment for taking that tone with me, buster.
<br><br>
* First, we will subject you to a creamed-corn enema, a humiliation sure to soften your aggressive personality into a puddle of shame.<br>
* Then we will hang your sheet out the window, suggesting to the entire world that you wet the bed like a stupid baby.<br>
* Finally, we will lock you in the closet with only blotter acid for food.
<br><br>
So help us help ourselves by helping you. Call Crawford Pines today.

You are suffering a crisis not unlike the Finnish. Y'all are spending too much time with one person who warms the cockles of your heart. They are also suffering from over-consumption of something they dearly love; namely, the heat of a roast-your-cockles-off sauna.
