                   KENNY ROGERS ... NOVELIST!

  Popular entertainer Kenny Rogers is not only a singer-song-
writer-actor, but he is also an author. According to the news
provider country.com, Rogers and screenwriter Donald Davenport
are about to publish a holiday-themed novel, "Christmas in
Canaan." The book is due out sometime next month. The scenario
for the book is the friendship that develops between a poor
white farm boy and a brilliant young black boy during the
early 1960s in rural Texas. This is not the first time that
Rogers has entered into the world of novel writing. He has
also written two children's books, "Kenny Rogers Presents:
The Greatest" and "The Toy Shoppe."

 MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S SPEECH SITE TO BE COMMEMORATED

You would have thought that in the decades since the late
Martin Luther King Jr. gave his immortal "I Have a Dream"
speech that some group would have remembered the spot where
he stood with a plaque or marker. Well, after all these
years of oversight, a group finally is. The Washington
Times says that the Washington Commission on Fine Arts has
OK'd the placement of a plaque on the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial where King stood on Aug. 28, 1963. The National
Capital Planning Commission, which would have to approve
the plaque because it would be on the steps of an existing
monument, is in agreement with the project. According to
published reports, the impetus behind the placement of the
plaque were the efforts of a member of Congress who had
been told by a constituent that he was surprised, while
visiting the Lincoln Memorial, that there was no commemora-
tive marker. Additionally, there are plans to built a monu-
ment to the slain civil rights leader not far away on the
banks of the Tidal Basin.

            FORMER KEKORIAN WIFE TO GET MORE MONEY

When the former wife of multi-millionaire movie and hotel
mogul Kirk Kerkorian went to court in Los Angeles recently
to try to get more money from her short-term hubby, little
did Lisa Bonder think the added payment would be $316 a
month. According to court records, the 37-year-old former
tennis pro is already getting about $50,000 a month from
Kerkorian in child support. Ironically the child being sup-
ported is not a product of their marriage. Bonder had been
asking for a third of a million a month. The judge said
that $50,316 seemed the right amount. Kerkorian, 84, was
married to Bonder for only a month in 1999.
