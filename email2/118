What You Need To Know About International Travel
 From John Fischer, your Editor and Guide

 --------------------------- EDITOR'S NOTE ----------------------------
 A new year has begun and their are major changes at all U.S. airports. This week we focus on those changes and what you can expect to find should you decide to fly on your next trip. On a side note, many airlines are offering super discounts in the first major price war of 2003. If you plan to travel in early 2003, now is the time to do some comparison price shopping.

 ------------------------- IN THE SPOTLIGHT ---------------------------
 Screening Checked Luggage

 -Air Travel Guide Arlene Fleming

 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/B8e
 Stepping up Airline Security

 -Canada for Visitors Guide Elke Mairs 
 New security measures have been introduced in the U.S. for all passengers commencing flights or making connections in the U.S. that will slow down your travel in the name of Homeland Security.

 Budget Travel Guidebooks from your Budget Travel Guide
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/B8p
 Guidebook authors would be the first to tell you that they cannot keep current on all the latest food, lodging, and entertainment bargains. But they can tell you about well-established budget haunts, and the methods for getting a good deal in a particular area. Here, I've featured guidebooks for Europe. But most of these authors/publishers offer destination guides for all continents. 
 1. Let's Go Western Europe
 Let's Go started as a service to Harvard students on break and has grown into one of the best resources available to a budget traveler. The writers have a deep appreciation for the classic sights but also seem to understand many of us cannot afford to pay a classic price to see these things. From world-class museums to the wonders of nature, this volume directs you to the best for less. 
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/B8m
 2. Europe Through the Back Door
 Rick Steves lays out a budget travel strategy as clearly and effectively as you'll find anywhere. This book is such an easy read that you'll find it hard to put down if you have any interest at all in visiting Europe. The "back door" concept Steves champions dictates living as do the locals--not only to save money, but to experience the culture as well. Some people are less than thrilled with his lodging recommendations, but his overall advice is sound. 
 http://slclk.about.com/?zi=1/B8n
 3. Fodor's Europe's Great Cities
 Fodor's Europe has been around for nearly 60 years, and that fact alone should testify to its usefulness. This is not a budget travel volume, but since many travelers are interested in the occasional splurge along with their bargains, this guide is worth considering. The authors tend to live in the cities about which they write, so the insights and tips are valuable. Newsweek calls it "the king of guidebooks."
