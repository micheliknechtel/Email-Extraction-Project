SIRAK: WELCOME BACK, ERNIE
Ernie Els has always had the game to be the chief rival for Tiger Woods,
but for some reason he has never risen to Tiger's level. But after a few
dormant years, Els seems poised to make a serious run at the world's best
player, writes Ron Sirak.

they found that winning on the PGA Tour does have its privileges.
