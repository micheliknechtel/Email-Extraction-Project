FROM THE HEART - January 2003 Poll
C'mon, fess up, we won't tell. How sexy do you like your romances?

If it were up to me, I'd never have to read another lovemaking scene in
a romance novel again. Now, excuse me, I need to wash and wax my floors
again.
One perfectly crafted moment of passion is just about right...as long as
it's 20 pages.
 It's all about balance (no, not the Kama Sutra!) not too excessive, but
not too innocent either--after all, that's part of the fun!
Steamier is better--why waste such gorgeous heroes and their strong arms
and broad chests and powerful hands and...oh, sorry, what was I saying?

 AVON Steamy Scene...

from...
THE WARRIOR'S GAME
by Denise Hampton

"Please Michel, you must let me go."
His expression didn't soften, but his hands opened and he took a half
step back from her. Ami let relief escape her on a heartfelt breath.
With the lift of her breast her mantle slid off the pin's shaft and the
garment spilled off her shoulders.

060509104> As Ami turned to catch it, Michel's hands again closed around
her arms, this time at her elbows. Without the thickness of her mantle
between them, she could feel the imprint of his fingers on her arms
right through the fabric of her sleeves. His hands slid down the length
of her arms until his thumbs moved at the crease of her elbows. The heat
of his caress burned through her garments to sear her flesh, then pulsed
through her body... More

months last year we conducted our first AVON ROMANCE site survey.  We =
asked YOU what types of features you would like to see at our site -- =
and as promised -- we've selected our grand prize winners.  Each will =
receive the hottest (and newest) AVON romance titles hot off the =
press.<br><br>
I'd like to extend a heartfelt "thank you" to all those (over 1000) who =
took the time to participate in our survey.  Here are our =
winners:<br><br></P>

His expression didn't soften, but his hands opened and he took a half =

As Ami turned to catch it, Michel's hands again closed around her arms, =
this time at her elbows. Without the thickness of her mantle between =

caress burned through her garments to sear her flesh, then pulsed =
through her body...<i><a =
